The ultimate research question for this project is whether training in improvisational theatre can provide scientists and science students with the ability to generate new inquiry spaces for their research?  Scientists and science educators are rarely taught how to build creative environments that encourage open exploration and risk taking. In contrast performers in improvisational theatre are explicitly trained to develop such environments and their ability for experimentation and risk taking. Improvisational theatre (IT) training is an established approach for stimulating creativity and team collaboration in business, early education and engineering design.  This emergent, collaborative idea generation and experimentation can lead to creative and transformative actions for the individual as well as the ensemble. Science education and research positioned as an improvisational, ensemble performance may give the ?actors? in the sciences the required lens for transforming their research and training into a continuous creative and innovative process.  This is crucial for the field of computational biology, as it is reliant on the generation of new scientific relationships, synergies and integrative methodologies.    Over the course of this project, educators, scientists and students in computing and computational biology disciplines will be brought together in improvisational theater workshops led by creative artists to 1) learn the principles of improvisational theatre 2) develop their ability to build creative, social risk-taking environments 3) develop indicators of creativity specific to the field of computational biology and 4) design improvisation exercises for creativity in computational biology that can be incorporated into the computational biology curriculum. A broad dissemination of the project results to journals and conferences in biology education, computational science and computing is anticipated. Improvisational exercises for concepts and creativity in computational biology will be made available via the project website and incorporated into submitted presentations and workshops at computing science symposiums and conferences that support scientific communities in the biosciences and support broadening participation initiatives for women and underrepresented minorities in the computing sciences.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The 2010 Summer Bioengineering Conference will be held June 16-20 in Naples, Florida. A hallmark of this meeting is the interaction and true integration of rigorous engineering principles and biologic concepts.     NSF funds will aid in reducing student registration fees; help in reimburse some of the student travel costs, to cover in part the publication costs of the program booklet and CD, and to help fund supplies for a special workshop aimed at enabling attendees to create partnerships with K-12 teachers in developing and implementing interactive STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) lessons.     This conference, with a focus on biomechanical engineering, brings together all different bioengineering communities including cell and molecular engineering, tissue engineering, functional tissue engineering, etc. It is co-sponsored by several bioengineering related societies.     The conference format will be 6 parallel sessions of oral presentations. Approximately 1/3rd to half of the accepted papers will be presented in poster format. A booklet will provide program details to the participants of the conference. All technical presentations will be two-page extended abstracts and compiled in a CD format, distributed to all registrants. Copies of this CD will also be provided to all co-sponsoring societies. The CD will serve as the only technical proceedings of the meeting.     Plenary lectures will highlight an outstanding speaker with lectures relevant for all attendees. Chris Rogers, the director of the Center for Engineering Education Outreach at Tufts University, will speak about his program to use robots to bring engineering education into the younger grades. Working with LEGO, he has developed ROBOLAB, a robotic approach to learning science and math. ROBOLAB has already gone into over 50,000 schools worldwide and has been translated into 15 languages.     One workshop titled Grand Challenge Competition to Predict knee Loads in Vivo will build on one presented in 2009. The aim of this competition is to advance the entire field of musculoskeletal modeling by critically evaluating muscle force estimates at the knee during gait using data collected from a patient with a force-measuring knee implant. Competitors will be given access to key biomechanical data and asked to use their unique computational models to predict knee contact forces.     Educational workshops will build on the success of sessions presented in 2009 (obtaining the ideal faculty position and teaching undergraduate biomechanics). They will include leadership and young and mid career development. The Speed Networking program piloted in 2008 will be expanded into an industry workshop focused on connecting industry with academia.     In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, it will serve an important cross-fertilization role. The organizers expect to have bioengineers, engineers from other disciplines, cell and molecular biologists, biochemists, biophysicists, and other scientists participating in the meeting. In that manner, this conference will have a much broader impact than if it were to be attended by just the bioengineering community. In addition, more than 50% of the attendees will be students. This will provide a broad impact for the current times as well as for the future as these students will benefit by participation in the meeting and through the material presented by the plenary speakers and workshops.

Spliceosomal RNAs are thought to catalyze two transesterification reactions that excise the pre-mRNA's intron and ligate its two exons together during nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. Recent in vitro studies support this idea. A U6/U2 RNA complex can splice together two exons in vitro in the absence of other spliceosomal factors. Furthermore, affinity-purified yeast spliceosomes under altered conditions in vitro can act in reverse to insert an intron into spliced exons. This ""reverse splicing"" is consistent with the reversibility of RNA-catalyzed transesterification reactions. Reverse splicing in the affinity-purified spliceosome is achieved in vitro by altering the pH and the concentrations of mono- and divalent cations. These alterations are likely changing RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions within the spliceosome. Thus it may be possible to reverse splicing by adding protein fragments to an arrested spliceosome to alter critical interactions, and thus induce the spliceosome to reverse splice under normal pH and salt conditions. In this project, this possibility will be tested by in vitro splicing assays using affinity purified spliceosomes and various fragments of a spliceosomal protein. Although these experiments are reasonably simple to perform, there is a high risk that they will be successful. The risk is in both the hypothesis and selecting the right protein fragments to test. However, if successful, the experiments will fundamentally alter our view of the regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing.    Broader impact. The research will have several immediate outcomes important to science and to education and training. The results will increase our understanding of the factors that regulate splicing. The ability to drive the spliceosome either forward or backward will reveal the most fundamental interactions within the spliceosome that control its catalytic activity.

Deposition of BC on ice/snow surfaces changes its albedo and enhances melting. The Arctic receives its BC from much of the northern hemisphere. Regional BC emissions have dramatically changed over these 45 years. Therefore, to develop strategies to limit BC and other PM transported to the Arctic, it is essential to determine the regional particulate mass (PM) contributions. The changing climate also affects the production of biogenic sulfate particles that increases the negative radiative forcing.     This collaborative project between Clarkson University and SUNY Albany/ Health   Research, Inc/ NYS Health Department with the cooperation of the Finnish Meteorological Institute will develop the world's longest record (45 year time series) of PM compositions of Arctic Haze at a single location by analyzing archived samples collected at Kevo, Finland. This work will: (1) determine the concentrations of BC, SO4 (sulfate), methane sulfonic acid (MSA), and other selected ions, cations and trace elements at Kevo for 45 continuous years; (2) investigate seasonal effects; (3) use state-of-the-art statistical methods, and air parcel back trajectories to determine the contributions of various emission regions and source types to the Arctic region.     This project has the following broader impacts. The resulting long term record of Arctic PM composition variation and its analyses will improve our understanding of Arctic change over nearly a half century. Insights into atmospheric transport and chemical transformation can be gleaned from these data, and identify trends that may extend into the future. The thoroughly analyzed and quality assured data set will be available to the scientific community for comparison of long-term BC and sulfate trends in the Arctic for model evaluations. The other species and data analysis will identify the PM sources over these 45 years.

This research will examine the choices and effectiveness of policies for mitigating the economic and public health effects of blooms of the harmful alga, Karenia brevis, along Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast.  The project team will develop a modeling framework comprising statistical models of the dynamics of nature and human demographics, environmental exposure-response models, cost-minimization models, and a policy-simulation model that connects these submodels.  An Education Program will be implemented to evaluate education and outreach tools that have been designed to minimize exposure to risks.  The research will focus on the following: (1) modeling the relationship between nutrient loadings and the frequency, spread, intensity, and duration of HABs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico; (2) clarifying the changing patterns of short- and long-term human population distributions along the Florida Gulf Coast; (3) specifying the connection between HABs as marine hazards (exposures) and human respiratory ailments (responses); (4) inputing the economic costs of illnesses associated with respiratory ailments; (5) demonstrating feasible ways of communicating risks to the public and implementing mitigation policies; (6) comparing the costs of implementing combinations of existing and prospective policies; and (7) characterizing the array of coupling phenomena (time lags, thresholds, feedback loops, surprises, etc.) that comprise the dynamic interactions between nature and humans in the HABs context.  The project is expected to yield insights into a form of dynamic coupling between nature and humans that heretofore has not been studied in depth, one in which policy choices must be made about the relative usefulness of attempts to control either nature or human behavior, or both, in order to reduce harm.    This research project will enhance our understanding of how the dynamic interactions between natural and human systems influence and inform society's choice of public policies for mitigating the economic and public health effects of marine harmful algal blooms (HABs).  The coupled natural-human system of HABs and increasing coastal populations on the Florida Gulf Coast appear to exhibit many of the classic characteristics of dynamic coupled systems, such as feedbacks, thresholds, surprises, and legacy effects.  A better understanding of these characteristics can potentially lead to public policies that are better organized, more informed, less costly, and more effective.

The adaptive immune system that generates antibodies against viruses is a well-characterized part of the antiviral defense, but this defense mechanism is only active in jawed-vertebrates. A second branch of the immune system, called the innate immune system, can also battle virus infection. The innate immune system is found in many different eukaryotic species and has been studied in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, but remains relatively poorly studied in fungi. This project will focus on studying the mechanisms that cells use to combat viruses and the tactics that viruses, in return, use to evade host defenses. A key challenge in the host defense is to distinguish normal cellular RNAs from RNAs encoded by viral invaders. Host messenger RNA generally contains a single strand of RNA that is modified at its 5' start with a cap structure and at its 3' end with a poly(A) tail. RNA from viruses may be double stranded, uncapped, and/or lack a poly(A) tail. Several branches of the innate immune system recognize these general features of viral RNA. This research aims to demonstrate through the use of Baker's yeast and Yeast killer viruses that eukaryotic cells have an additional type of innate immunity against viral infection. Yeast contains Ski proteins, which function in RNA decay, and have an antiviral function. The hypothesis is that the yeast Ski proteins recognize RNA that lacks a poly(A) tail, such as viral RNA, and target it for degradation. It has been shown that the L-A virus has a process to produce uncapped cellular mRNA, and the mechanism by which this aids virus replication will also be investigated.  The research will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which viruses evade the host innate immune system.

Secreted proteins of the Wnt family represent one such signal. Wnts elicit precise changes in gene expression mediated by increased levels of the transcription factor Beta-catenin. Too much, or too little, of this signal leads to patterning defects and/or disease.     Wnts induce a Beta-catenin signal by blocking the function of the central pathway regulator, a protein complex assembled around the scaffold protein Axin. Multiple, potentially conflicting, inputs interact within the Axin complex. How these different inputs are integrated and dynamically controlled during Wnt signal transduction remains unclear. The focus of this project is to establish a dynamic model of Wnt/B-catenin signaling by identifying the location of the Axin complex and its sub-complexes during signal transduction. Genetic manipulations will then be used to determine the functional significance of the findings.    The current model of the Wnt/B-catenin pathway is based largely on studies using overexpression in tissue culture, and protein-protein interactions in vitro. The functional significance of these findings for normal signaling in vivo remains unclear. Significantly, in the proposed studies, the Wnt/B-catenin pathway will be analyzed in the model organism Drosophila, allowing its analysis in the normal cellular context and under physiological conditions. Additionally, visualization of the Axin protein complexes in real-time will establish a dynamic picture of Wnt signaling not achieved in previous studies. These studies are expected to identify novel regulatory interactions and may open the Wnt pathway to pharmacological intervention.

Actin-binding proteins are important modulators of cellular function.  They are particularly important in the nervous system, where they modulate the function of the actin cytoskeleton, which in turn, modulates processes such as the formation of axons, dendrites and synapses; vesicle recycling, synaptic activity and synaptic plasticity.  This project will determine the function of the recently discovered neuronal actin-binding protein Kelch-like 1 (or KLHL1).  In particular, this research will expand our knowledge of the role that this novel structural protein plays in calcium channel function, which is critical for intracellular communication and neurotransmission.  KLHL1 modulates calcium channel function by a newly identified pathway.  This project seeks to establish the cellular mechanism of this novel type of modulation.  The specific goals of this project are two-fold:  (1) To determine the physiological impact of the elimination of KLHL1.  The hypothesis is that the absence of KLHL1 in neurons results in altered neuronal function. (2) To determine the cellular mechanism by which KLHL1 modulates calcium channel function. The hypothesis is that KLHL1 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton within the neurons, altering the rate of endosomal recycling and resulting in the increased presence of calcium channels at the neuronal cell membrane.

Genes are linearly arrayed on chromosomes, and their basic features are preserved between simple and complex organisms.  This research uses a model organism, baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to explore the ways in which genes are regulated.  In both yeast and humans, genes are either turned on (activated) or off (repressed) as a consequence of the activities of specific proteins that bind DNA in a sequence-specific (gene-specific) fashion.  This research will focus on studying the detailed role of a large, evolutionarily conserved protein complex termed Mediator that receives signals from these DNA-binding proteins and integrates them in a way that dictates the expression of individual genes.  Thus, Mediator function is akin to that of a computer: it processes large amounts of input information, in the form of intracellular signals, and creates an output, e.g., the complex pattern of gene expression that defines the unique biology of an organism or cell type.  This research will take advantage of a set of unique genetic mutations within five subunits centered at Mediator's core. These mutations strongly perturb the expression of genes that respond to environmental stresses such as elevated temperature, chemical toxicity, or oxidative stress.  Therefore, characterization of the mutations, and the five subunits they affect, will provide important insight into the biological function of Mediator.    Broader Impacts.

They will then develop statistical models and computational algorithms to track the individuals in the group and to recognize facial expressions and vocalizations. Patterns in movements, expressions, and vocalizations will be used to develop behavior-identifying algorithms that will recognize different behaviors such as aggression, submission, grooming, eating and sleeping. The project is a collaboration between computer scientists and primatologists. A key element of this project is the observation that complex social interactions can often be regarded as being composed of sequences of elementary behaviors which occur frequently and consist of relatively simple and distinct gestures. Thus, the task of modeling complex social interactions can be broken down into two regimes - elementary behaviors spanning short duration, and their stochastic sequences spanning relatively longer time duration.     Apart from advancing computational science, the new methods for recording behavior unobtrusively and analyzing them at a high data rate are likely to be of interest to behavioral ecologists, socio-biologists and neuroscientists in studies of primates and other highly social animals.

But in addition to writing systems, many symbol systems have been developed that, though they do communicate information, do not encode language. Such non-linguistic symbol systems include familiar examples such as mathematical symbology, European heraldry, or scouting merit badges, as well as less familiar ones such as Mesopotamian deity symbols or Dakota winter counts.  Like writing, such systems are an important part of the cultures that created them.    Now suppose one has a symbol system whose interpretation is unknown. Short of deciphering it as a writing system, or otherwise providing a rigorous testable interpretation, are there any methods that can determine whether one is dealing with writing or a non-linguistic system? Some recent high-profile papers have indeed claimed to provide statistical evidence that a couple of ancient systems were linguistic. But, one problem with that work is that in order to determine which of two categories an unknown system belongs to, it is very useful to have a large set of examples of the two categories in question. In the case of writing systems, we now have many electronic corpora from hundreds of languages, both ancient and modern. But electronic corpora of non-linguistic systems are few.    This project will fill this void by developing and releasing to the public electronic corpora of a range of non-linguistic systems, including those named above as well as several others.

Centrosomes organize the microtubule cytoskeleton that is required for cell structure and organelle movement. Nuclei maintain the genetic material that provides instruction for nearly every cell action. Interactions between these organelles play important roles in cell polarity, motility, development, and division. While genetic and molecular analyses reveal a complex framework of proteins that interconnect these two organelles, how these interactions are established and maintained remains poorly understood. Moreover, virtually nothing is known about how these physical interactions influence the replicative cycles of centrosomes and nuclei. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that coordinate centrosomal and nuclear cycles. Through the deletion of a kinesin molecular motor, previous work has developed a novel means to uncouple these two organelles and yet maintain cell viability. This deletion leads to supernumerary centrosome accumulation and to errors in cell division that ultimately impact cell growth. The project will utilize combinations of light and electron microscopy, and laser ablation of cell organelles to determine how centrosome replication is governed by nuclear attachment. Efforts will establish whether multiple attachment mechanisms are at play and distinguish between their functional roles, address nuclear vs. cytoplasmic requirements for spindle assembly in a closed mitotic system, and determine how the kinesin motor participates in the attachment process. Overall the objectives will lead to an understanding of the mechanisms by which centrosomes engage nuclei and how these two organelles coordinate their functions to maintain cell viability and genomic stability.

EC aerosols play a key role in regional and global climate forcing because of absorption of solar radiation and possible cloud formation. EC also impacts the environment and human health as a major component of fine particulate matter. In the northeastern United States, sources of EC aerosols have changed dramatically during the last century, and these changes are reflected in atmospheric concentrations of EC. However, past data on atmospheric EC is sparse. It is hypothesized that atmospheric EC can be determined from the EC concentrations in lake sediments.    Daily aerosol samples will be collected at Whiteface Mt., NY between 2011 and 2014. These filters along with archived filters for 2006-2010 will be analyzed for EC concentration to provide continuous data from 1978 to 2014.

These are exciting findings because they indicate that estrogen insufficiency may impact hearing function and manipulations directed at estrogen levels may ameliorate or recover hearing dysfunction triggered by hormonal deficits. Although these novel findings are promising, it is necessary to uncover the mechanisms by which estrogen impacts the functionality of auditory neurons and the functional relevance of this hormonal modulation. This project will address these gaps by using a combination of molecular biology, electrophysiology and high-throughput proteomics approaches to understand: 1) how estrogen controls the activation of auditory neurons by acoustic signals; 2) how estrogen shapes selectivity of neuronal responses to auditory signals; 3) the gene expression programs controlled by estrogen in auditory neurons.

Acid sensing channels, a member of this family of proteins, are transmembrane proteins that bind to protons and open channels that are specific for cations. They not only play a critical role in neurotransmission in higher vertebrates but also play a role in mediating sensory responses proteins in lower vertebrates such as worms, flies, hydra, and sea urchins which have proteins with similar sequences. A recent structure of one type of the acid sensing channel indicates that the mechanism by which this protein responds to protons (lower pH) is by the protonation of acidic residues present on the extracellular side of  this protein. The proposed project will test this hypothesis and establish if these residues are indeed the sensors for the acidic pH. For these studies the vibrations of the acidic residues will be investigated to determine if they are protonated at the pH where the protein functions. In addition, the proposed research will also determine the structural changes initiated by protonation that ultimately leads to the formation of the cation channel. To study these large scale structural changes in the protein the investigator will attach fluorescent probes at specific sites, and determine distances between the probes by measuring the extent of energy transfer from one site to the other. The changes at specific carboxylate residues and the large scale structural changes will then be contextualized in terms of electrical measurements that allow for characterization of the opening and closing of the cation channels.

However, there is overwhelming physiological evidence that estrogens have rapid effects in the brain and other non-neural tissues that do not involve these classical receptors but rather is thought to involve a plasma membrane localized estrogen receptor. Indeed, a novel compound called STX has been synthesized that selectively activates this membrane estrogen receptor and mediates many of the physiological processes ascribed to estrogen without the growth promoting effects.

Evaluation will include both the use of the tools in a public health context as well as the ease with which new information services and systems are built and deployed. Given the wide range of potential applications students will be recruited from a wide variety of disciplines including the University of Washington Medical School, School of Public Health, and Information School and inter-disciplinary projects will be introduced into undergraduate capstone courses.    As the work is multi-disciplinary, research results will be as well. The focus is on human-computer interaction, mobile systems, communication, and software engineering.   The primary technical challenges are in management of mobile data collection, expanding the sensing/perception capabilities of mobile phones for health, and architecting distributed information services.  Improved methods for organizing data collection campaigns and their sustainable management in terms of both the deployment of instruments on mobile devices and tools to supervise the data collectors themselves will be foremost.  Connecting mobile phones and their sensors in a structured arrangement that will allow use of everything from paper and cheap voice/SMS phones on one end of the spectrum to smartphones and tablets on the other will be a significant contribution to data collection methods.  Exploiting standard interfaces and internet protocols between cloud-based modules will formalize the development of data architectures (above basic databases) that embody work processes and sustain management feedback loops.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Such test errors lead to delays, additional clinical evaluation, additional expense, and sometimes to erroneous treatments that increase risk to patients.  One recent study suggests that errors in measured total blood calcium concentration due to instrument mis-calibration alone cost from $60M to $199M annually in the US. However, the vast majority of clinical laboratory errors do not originate in instrument mis-calibration. Clinical laboratory errors affect about 0.5% of samples collected.  Of those, approximately 75% of clinical laboratory test errors originate during sample collection, transport, and storage before samples reach the analysis instruments i.e., the pre-analytic phase.  However the quality control measures standard in hospital clinical test labs only monitor instrument calibration and are therefore completely blind to sample faults introduced in the pre-analytic phase, where most errors originate.  Data derived from patient samples, rather than instrumentation calibration checks, holds the key to detect faults introduced in the pre-analytic phase.  Current methods are either so insensitive to errors that they do not detect sample faults reliably, or they routinely flag normal samples as being faulty.    This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers  from Oregon Health and Science University and Northeastern University with expertise in machine learning, signal processing, and laboratory medicine to develop and apply statistical machine learning technology to reliably detect errors in hospital clinical laboratory tests, using data derived from patient samples.  The primary obstacle to developing reliable statistical detectors for lab errors is the cost of labeling samples combined with the low error rate.  Developing and evaluating any automated error-detection algorithm requires a sufficient number of samples, both faulty and non-faulty. Determining which tests are faulty requires review of the tests and other patient data (e.g. charts) by a clinical lab expert - a time-consuming and economically unfeasible prospect given the low fault rate.  The project addresses this challenge through active learning paradigms used to select, with emphasis on rare classes, subsets of the data for labeling by human experts.  The project focuses on chronic kidney disease because of its medical importance and large data repository at Oregon Health and Science University. This research will provide algorithms for clinical lab error detection that will extend to tests used in other disease entities (for example diabetes and heart failure).      Ultimately, the error-detection algorithms developed from this research will make their way into clinical laboratory information systems and further into commercialization and thus deployment on a scale significant enough to have widespread positive impact on laboratory costs patient risk.

However, for effective planning of health, social, and other services and for apportioning government funds, there has been a growing demand to produce similar estimates for small geographic areas and subpopulations, commonly referred to as small areas.  This research project aims at developing a new method of small area estimation that potentially will lead to a dramatic improvement in accuracy over the traditional methods in practical situations.  Model-based small area estimation utilizes statistical models, such as mixed effects models, to ""borrow strength.""  In particular, the empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) is a well-known model-based method that has had dominant influence in small area estimation.  From a practical point of view, however, any proposed model is subject to model misspecification.  When the proposed statistical model is incorrect, EBLUP is no longer efficient or even effective.  In such cases, a new method, known as observed best prediction (OBP), may be superior.  This project involves several important research topics on OBP, including theoretical developments, assessment of uncertainties under weak model assumptions, and implementation of the OBP via user-friendly software.  The research largely will expand the results of our earlier studies, and contribute to making the OBP method more effective, practical, and easy to use.    The research introduces a completely new idea and method to model-based statistical methods in survey sampling.  It is expected to impact other scientific areas where statistical methods have been used for prediction problems.  The project will develop and freely disseminate R code to implement the OBP method.  The education component of the project will introduce the OBP method into courses at the investigators' institutes.  These courses are expected to draw students and researchers from statistics, biostatistics, genetic epidemiology, animal and plant sciences, educational research, social sciences, and government agencies.

Historically, gender specificity has been ignored in order to avoid experimental variability. However, it is becoming clear in recent years that biological impacts of gender profoundly alters the way the brain responds to its environment. Therefore, the long range goal of this project is to understand how gender alters the brain?s response to estradiol. This goal is important because it challenges some of the current assumptions about how the brain responds to hormones. There is an extensive literature that documents the beneficial effects of estrogen on the brain. It is also known that both female and male brains are exposed to estradiol, from the ovaries and/or via the conversion of testosterone to estrogen by the enzyme aromatase. However, less is known about how gender alters the brain?s response to estrogen. To address this issue, male and female rat neurons are cultured separately and used as an experimental model system to examine biochemical responses to estradiol. Based on preliminary data, it is predicted that male neurons are less responsive to estradiol than female neurons. The current project will confirm or reject this prediction and future work will determine whether this gender difference is genetic or a consequence of in utero hormone exposure. This project is consistent with the goals of the National Science Foundation: ?To promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare??  Given that gender differences are central to understanding the human condition, a better understanding of its role will serve to advance national health, prosperity and welfare.

It has also become clear that the timing of puberty is under genetic control, and likely determined by a host of regulatory genes. Yet, few attempts have been made to identify the genetic networks controlling this critical milestone in mammalian development. Drs. Sergio Ojeda (a neuroscientist) and Kemal Sönmez (a computer/electrical engineer) have combined expertise and developed a partnership between biology and engineering to test the hypothesis that a repressive gene network operating within the brain controls the initiation of female puberty. Using a combination of computational methods, systems biology approaches and molecular strategies, they performed preliminary studies revealing the existence of such a network and showing that it represses subordinate genes, which if left unchecked, would unleash the pubertal process prematurely. To disseminate their findings, Ojeda and Sönmez will partner with the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle to generate a database resource of Web-based tools, links and protocols for analyses accessible via Internet.  They will also make their raw data, results, and codes available on their website (www.sonmezsysbio.org), and deposit their data and results in public databases. Because the research plan includes the participation of undergraduate students and high-school students, The project will encourage young investigators to use similar integrative approaches for the study of many other complex physiological processes in mammalian systems.

The nucleosome, composed of a set of core histone proteins and DNA, is the basic building block of chromatin and acts as a primary scaffold for chromosome protection and compaction. Nucleosomes also act as barriers to restrict access to DNA and as a result can serve to prevent the expression of genes and consequently block cell division. Chromatin remodeling is a key step in the process of gene activation through disruptions of DNA-histone contacts that result in changes in DNA wrapping within nucleosomes, referred to as chromatin accessibility. Highly conserved from yeast to vertebrates, chromatin remodeling complexes (such as the SWI/SNF complex) function as essential cofactors to initiate gene transcription and assist in the regulation of transcription elongation as well as alternative splicing that produces different forms of the same gene. Fundamental questions needing to be resolved include how these complexes are targeted to genes in vivo and how they contribute mechanistically to both transcription activation and repression. Although generally acknowledged that chromatin structure can influence how gene transcripts are spliced to produce a variety of protein forms from the same gene, many assumptions are made and questions remain concerning the role of the nucleosome in vivo. This project tests the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling complexes contribute to gene repression through regulated remodeling of nucleosomes that normally act as impediments to transcription elongation at critical points in development. The research will address the in vivo functions of nucleosome remodeling complexes using biochemical assays of chromatin compaction, protein binding to chromatin and unique leading edge genetic tools developed for this research study. This project uses the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster as a genetic model system to provide much needed and more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms by which chromatin remodeling complexes participate in programming gene expression during development. The results derived from this research are likely to have important and widespread implications for understanding the roles of the chromosome building blocks in gene regulation, as well as the remodeling enzyme complexes that control how that genome information is accessed by other factors, including the regulation of RNA polymerase elongation and alternative splicing in diverse systems.    Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of this project include (1) providing opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate (both MS and PhD) students to directly participate in mentored research, and (2) widespread dissemination of the results of this research through invited seminars and presentations at national meetings. Specifically, this research project will seek to actively recruit and train students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups, including local high school students from the Maywood (IL) and greater Chicago area, as well as college undergraduate students. Trainees will be mentored in basic research and assigned non-trivial roles on the project. Multidisciplinary training and education are vital to prepare students for diverse science careers; therefore, students are encouraged to think creatively and, in order to function effectively in the laboratory, they are taught developmental biology, genetics, scientific techniques, molecular/cellular biology and biochemistry. Students are also taught how to read and evaluate scientific literature, they are encouraged to identify role models to enforce their educational objectives, and to train them to give clear presentations, they attend and present at lab meetings for faculty and other students. Students are also encouraged to present their work at regional and national meetings and also to collaborate with expert investigators outside the institution in diverse scientific fields to enhance their multidisciplinary training experience.

Upon oxidation of Mn(II), Mn(III,IV) oxides are deposited at the sea floor as crusts, nodules and sediments both near and far from the sources. Microbial activity has long been recognized as being important to the fate of Mn in these hydrothermal systems, yet we know very little about the organisms that catalyze Mn oxidation, the mechanisms by which Mn is oxidized or the physiological function that Mn oxidation serves. The overarching goals of this project are to reveal the organisms and mechanism(s) underlying Mn(II) oxidation, to evaluate whether hydrothermal Mn oxidizers may obtain energy from Mn oxidation, and test whether thermophilic Mn oxidizers exist. Specifically, the project will: 1) evaluate whether we can identify certain genomic sequences that correlate to the presence/concentration of Mn oxides (and hence Mn(II)- oxidizing bacteria) by comparing the metagenomes of ferromanganese (containing both Mn and Fe oxides) microbial mats with ferruginous (Fe oxide only) mats from Lau Basin and Loihi Seamount; 2) use peptide probes bound to magnetic particles for selectively binding and capturing Mn oxide particles and characterizing the particles using phylogenetic and functional gene (PCR and FISH) and transcriptomic analysis; 3) assess the main pathways of carbon fixation in ferromanganese microbial mats as compared to ferruginous mats as a possible indicator of Mn-based auto/mixotrophy using genomic approaches and substrate stimulated (e.g., addition of Mn(II)) CO2 fixation measurements and stable isotope probing (SIP) genomic analysis; and 4) isolate and characterize Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria and determine whether thermophilic Mn oxidizers exist.    Intellectual merit  The results of this research will increase our understanding of Mn(II) oxidation in hydrothermal sediments, identify microorganisms that are the environmentally relevant Mn oxidizers and begin to address the long standing question of whether Mn auto/mixotrophy exists using approaches not based on the biases associated with cultivation. Ultimately this information is critical to our understanding of biogeochemical cycles (Mn oxidation and Mn oxides impact many other elemental cycles, including carbon, sulfur, and heavy metals) and the natural attenuation of toxic metal and organic compounds; this may lead to improved technologies for environmental remediation. Because Mn oxides are believed to be an analog to the ancestral Mn centers in photosystem II, this research may also lend new insights into ancient biogeochemistry occurring before the Great Oxidation Event.

This work capitalizes on the ability to manipulate superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with magnetic field remotely and noninvasively.  In this approach, the NSCs are labeled with nanoengineered cationic magnetoliposomes (CMLs) which encapsulate numerous SPIONs, and can be injected into the injured spinal cord in colloidal suspensions.  Upon the application of a magnetic field, magnetically labeled NSCs will spontaneously self-assemble into chain/column lattices and align along a virtual axis that is defined by the field flux lines, thereby forming a scaffold to guide the directional regrowth of axons.  Neurotrophic factors stored in the bilayer of the CMLs can be released by radio frequency electromagnetic triggering to promote NSC survival and axonal growth.        If successful, this research will transform state-of-the-art of biological scaffold fabrication in tissue engineering, when directional guidance is desired for cellular growth and expansion, and enhance the therapeutic strategies for challenging issues of experimental spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases.  This work will also help to greatly expand the use of SPIONs in general clinical applications by changing their role from passive tracer (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents) to active enabler of biological processes.

With the penetration of these digital products into households, the average U.S. infant and toddler now invests approximately two hours each day with media, beginning with DVD viewing in the first months of life followed by computer exposure in a parent's lap at about age 2. These early media use patterns persist despite the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics that children should not experience screen exposure before the age of 2. Although preliminary data do suggest negative effects of screen exposure when infants are heavily exposed to television programs designed for adult audiences, little is currently known about the positive or negative effects of programs designed for very young children, or how infants and toddlers come to understand these first media experiences. An interdisciplinary research team from the Children's Digital Media Center will use a multi-theoretical and multi-method approach to track early digital media exposure and how that exposure influences infants' and very young children's attention and learning. Guiding the research program are two distinct but complementary theories, one involving the comprehensibility of the content and the other focusing on the grammar of media (formal features such as action, music, and sound effects). As one component of the program, national surveys will document patterns of change and continuity over time in very young children's access to, and uses of, various digital media platforms, such as DVDs, computers, and music. A second component will entail content analyses of the formal production features used in popular digital products for the very young. This formal feature analysis will be used, in part, to set the stage for selecting and creating stimuli for experimental and observational research. This third component will involve determining how infants and very young children learn from digital media exposure. Experimental studies will also be employed to examine factors that influence major cognitive accomplishments, such as understanding that events presented on a screen can represent real-life events. Together with other methods, the experimental research will include eye-tracking studies to pinpoint how very young children learn to read a screen.     In contrast to popular belief, infants' digital media use functions as more than a surrogate for a babysitter. Rather, digital media use is a major environmental influence from the earliest months of life. This project will provide new information about the early exposure of very young children to media specifically created for them and advance current understanding of the most critical features involved in the construction of these products. The project will also generate knowledge of the means by which infants and toddlers come to understand symbolic media presentations, a key to understanding infants' intellectual development. The outcomes of this project will likely guide the development of digital products designed for the very young, may influence federal media policies, and inform parental decisions about the media choices and early media exposure that they provide for their infants and young children.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Although many different signals affect this process, the complexity of higher mammals has made it difficult to determine how specific proteins control cell movements within the brain.  As an alternative strategy, simpler insect nervous systems can be used to model how particular types of proteins affect cell behavior, providing the framework for testing the role of related proteins in higher animals.  This project will exploit the unique advantages of insect preparations to define the role of an important class of cell surface receptors called ""Ig-CAMS"", which are found in all nervous systems but whose functions are poorly understood. Time-lapse imaging and fluorescent labeling will be used to determine how different Ig-CAMs control distinct patterns of cell movement.

Injury to humans causes pain, which can be long lasting (even permanent) and sometimes untreatable. Although much has been learned about other aspects of human biology through comparative studies of simpler animals, including selected invertebrates, systematic comparative studies of behavioral and neural responses to injury in invertebrates have been lacking. This project will compare behavioral and neural responses to peripheral injury in two invertebrates that, because of their giant neurons, have been sources of pioneering discoveries in neuroscience: the common Atlantic squid, Loligo, and a large marine snail, Aplysia. Both are molluscs, but they have very different life styles and cognitive capabilities. Hypotheses to be tested include: (1) In the peripheral sensory neurons of both species, injury-induced, long-lasting behavioral sensitization involves a similar long-term enhancement of responsiveness that resembles the effects reported in mammals, (2) these changes are induced by common chemical signals that also drive inflammatory pain in mammals, (3) the large-brained squid, but not small-brained snail display ongoing awareness of an injury, and (4) sensitization of defensive responses in the squid increases the chances of survival in a wounded state by decreasing the vulnerability to predatory attacks.

Here, the investigators propose to use optical techniques, combined with genetically-encoded proteins, to measure and control the pH of live nerve cells in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Fluorescent proteins will be used to measure pH, and light-activated proton pumps will be used to control pH. When deployed in the same cell, these proteins will provide the means for establishing dynamic control of pH. These tools will be invaluable for investigating the extent to which the pH fluctuates in nerve cells during naturally occurring activity, and for testing the role of these pH changes in maintaining the capacity of the nerve cells to transfer and store information.

The studies will not only focus on understanding the cycling of Mn between its various oxidation states but will determine the concentration and distribution of Mn(II) in stratified coastal ocean waters and in sediment porewaters. The study will also examine the potentially important role of Mn(III) in mediating and influencing the biogeochemical cycling of Mn with that of Fe and S, which are both important components of the major ocean chemical cycles. A better understanding of the biogeochemistry of Mn will inform not only scientists interested in metal cycling in the ocean but also those focused on studies across redox transition zones.

The research group will (1) perform novel analytical and computational studies of important constituent processes, (2) incorporate experimental data into these studies, and (3) develop and apply state-of-the-art numerical algorithms to large-scale computations over multiple time and space scales. By integrating experimental data with sophisticated, multi-scale mathematical and computational models, the potential for breakthroughs that will significantly further the understanding of tumor biology are great, thereby addressing a pressing national and global need.     Solid tumors are complex micro-structured materials, where the three-dimensional tissue architecture (morphology) and dynamics are coupled in complex, nonlinear ways to cellular characteristics and to molecular composition and structure of the growth environment. This close connection between the tumor morphology and the underlying cellular/molecular dynamics has fundamental scientific importance in that the cellular dynamics that give rise to various tumor morphologies also control its ability to invade the host tissue. This allows observable properties of the tumor, such as its morphology, to be used to both understand the underlying cellular physiology and predict the tumors invasion potential. In particular, the conjecture that diverse morphologic patterns of invasion observed during tumor growth are the quantitatively predictable result of molecular inhomogeneity (of both composition and structure) in the tumors growth environment will be tested. Because tumor cells use similar or identical migration and proliferation mechanisms as normal cells, and because of the multi-scale nature of these processes, the mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation that will be conducted in this project will also have application in understanding normal functional processes during development, wound-healing, stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. This project will also establish a new collaboration among five institutions and broadens the participation of women and minorities in research as trainees in the investigators? groups, thereby addressing national needs. It will provide interdisciplinary training with theoreticians and experimentalists at the interface between mathematics and tumor cell biology. Finally, a month-long summer COSMOS (California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science) course at UC Irvine will be developed for high school students on these topics.

The ResD-ResE two-component signal transduction system and the NO-sensitive NsrR repressor play key roles in controlling transcription of genes involved in anaerobiosis. B. subtilis NsrR contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster and represses transcription of ResD-controlled nasDEF (nitrite reductase genes) and hmp (flavohemoglobin gene). Interaction of NO with the [4Fe-4S] cluster alleviates binding of NsrR to the nasD and hmp promoters, leading to derepression (class I regulation). NsrR also plays a role in more global transcription by interacting with A+T-rich DNA in an NO-insensitive manner at least in vitro (class II regulation). Class II genes are upregulated by an nsrR mutation when pyruvate is present, and this upregulation is ResD-dependent. This research will investigate a critical link between ResD and NsrR, two major transcriptional regulators that play pivotal roles in anaerobiosis of B. subtilis. As binding of NsrR to class II genes shows relaxed sequence specificity and a target bias that likely involves DNA topology, the in vivo interaction of NsrR with the promoter regions of class II genes will be determined. Sensitivity of DNA interaction to NO will be compared between class I and class II promoters in parallel with evaluation of NO effects on transcription of corresponding genes. Transcription of class II NsrR-controlled genes is often regulated by other transcription factors, such as ResD and AbrB, that also target A+T rich DNA. This research will characterize how multiple transcription factors affect NsrR binding at specific target genes. Studies of a novel regulatory mechanism of NsrR and accompanying NsrR-dependent global regulation will advance our understanding of transcriptional control in response to oxygen limitation and how multiple transcriptional regulators control expression of selected genes in response to a variety of environmental signals.

Proteins inserted in the membrane act like batteries and use the energy to move molecules in or out of the cell, making the chemical composition appropriate for normal cell function.  The membrane protein called melibiose permease (MelB), present in certain bacteria, couples the transport of a sodium ion with a sugar (melibiose) molecule into the cell. In fact, it uses the favorable energy for sodium entry to build a high sugar concentration in the cell. A MelB human homologue is widely expressed in many tissues and has been found to be physiologically important.  There are many proteins that work similarly, yet the precise mechanisms are not understood. The three-dimensional structure of MelB (at the atomic level) will constitute a breakthrough essential for the understanding of the molecular mechanism of transport. This project aims to obtain the high-resolution crystal structure of MelB by X-ray crystallography and to identify the specific amino acids in the protein responsible for selecting melibiose and sodium ion. This will be done by generating mutant proteins and testing their function with quantitative biochemical and biophysical methods. The results from this research will add crucial information to the understanding of how a membrane protein converts ionic energy to move sugar or other nutrients into a cell.

In eukaryotic cells, the genome is organized into a DNA/protein complex called chromatin.  Chromatin can exist in two forms, termed ""euchromatin"" and ""heterochromatin.""

Euchromatin typically contains actively expressing genes (e.g., those that are ON), while heterochromatin typically contains inactive genes (i.e., those that are OFF, silent).  This project will explore the molecular basis for how genes that are located in heterochromatin, and are therefore normally silent, get turned ON (e.g., become ""transcriptionally activated"") in response to stresses such as high temperature or exposure to toxic chemicals.  The project will use the power of yeast genetics combined with the modern techniques of molecular biology and biochemistry.  Building on previous results that suggested genes in heterochromatin are activated in a fundamentally different way than genes in euchromatin, this project will provide important mechanistic insights into this striking dichotomy.

We know very little about this fungus as there are huge gaps in our knowledge of how fungi thrive in cold conditions and what unique traits make them pathogenic. Specifically, the forms and functions of fungi at low temperature have not yet been subjected to genetic analyses. Therefore, the unique enzymes and proteins that make psychrophilic life possible at such extreme low temperature remain unknown and their biotechnology potential remains unrealized. The investigators in this project propose to remove major barriers to experimental investigations of psychrophilic fungi by providing a molecular toolkit for the experimental manipulation of G. destructans and its psychrophilic sibling species G. pannorum. The experimental focus will be on the development of reliable systems for the manipulation, deletion or over-expression of target genes in G. destructans and G. pannorum.  These approaches would allow assignment of specific roles for various genes of interest. Additional objectives will focus on labeling two fungal species with stable fluorescent proteins so that details of fungal development can be studied by high resolution microscopy.

Since HONO is readily photolyzed to hydroxyl radical (OH) and nitric oxide, it is further hypothesized that photolysis of particulate nitrate (pNO3) in aerosol particles represents an important pathway to recycle nitric acid/nitrate back to photochemically reactive nitrogen oxides in the troposphere. A series of research activities will be undertaken involving field measurements, laboratory experiments and modeling. Specifically:    * Measurements will be made during flights of the NSF/National Center for Atmospheric Research C-130 research aircraft to establish HONO concentration distributions in background continental and oceanic air masses over the southeastern U.S and adjacent coastal waters and to establish relationships between the daytime HONO production and other physical and chemical parameters, including pNO3, particulate organic matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, aerosol particle surface area, and solar radiation.    * Aerosol samples collected from the C-130 will be used in laboratory experiments to determine the HONO production rate from the photolysis of aerosol pNO3 on filters.    * Model calculations will be done based on the results of field measurements and laboratory experiments, to examine pNO3 photolysis and nitrogen dioxide uptake on organic aerosol as a HONO source and investigate if pNO3 photolysis is an efficient re-recycling pathway for nitric acid/nitrate, and    * To evaluate the role of this processes in tropospheric photochemistry    The research will provide information on the vertical distribution of HONO, nitric acid, pNO3 and other relevant parameters in the troposphere. If the above two hypotheses are proven valid, there are significant atmospheric implications: The troposphere may be more photochemically reactive than generally predicted, due to the remobilized HONO and nitrogen oxides as well as elevated OH levels, generally leading to an enhanced production of ozone and secondary particles. The research may therefore significantly improve our understanding of tropospheric reactive nitrogen chemistry and atmospheric oxidation capacity on regional and global scales. The project will also provide research and training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the field of atmospheric chemistry.

Increasing spectrum demand along with years of growing regulatory support for innovative wireless technologies like DSA presents a unique opportunity to show how spectrum sharing approaches and technologies can wring abundance from scarcity by finding ways to use spectrum more efficiently. The objectives of this research are to quantify the cost/benefit tradeoffs and validate the regulatory and system requirements for sensing-based, geo-location and hybrid broadband systems that can coexist with Federal users. The project will consist of technical and economic modeling and simulations of several policy-based, DSA-enabled system configurations under a wide range of scenarios in selected Federal bands currently under regulatory review for potential reallocation. It will create detailed spectrum sharing system design documents that include comprehensive entrant and incumbent user requirements, architectures and costs (including initial testing, validation and transaction costs, incremental capital costs, implementation costs and recurring operational costs). It will culminate with a demonstration plan to field test the most cost-effective sharing approaches.     This broader impact of this project will be in the multiple benefits resulting from improving spectrum efficiency, lowering costs and fostering American innovation. Enabling spectrum sharing accelerates by 5 to 10 years the transition process through proven approaches that allow co-existence of new and incumbent systems. DSA-enabled spectrum sharing on both a geographic and temporal basis greatly increases the overall capacity of broadband wireless systems. This technology also facilitates band clearing in Federal bands, where appropriate, and maximizes spectrum access where relocation of Federal incumbents would be too costly or infeasible. This avoids having to redirect funds from auction proceeds to cover Federal government efforts in planning, redesigning and moving every existing system. It also relieves the pressure to auction more exclusive use spectrum licenses by enabling innovative unlicensed, light licensing and other models. When Federal systems must be relocated, DSA allows them to gain equivalent or improved spectrum access in other bands. This project will greatly improve the understanding of DSA-enabled spectrum sharing by identifying stakeholder requirements and cost effective solutions. It will prove that these capabilities are feasible and benefits real by producing cost data for different DSA approaches, allowing operators, regulators and incumbents to understand whether costs align with bandwidth gains.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Spectrum,1,False

A cohort is a group of patients with a common medical condition. Cohorts underpin modern medical care, defining treatment algorithms, measuring quality improvement, supporting government initiatives, and representing the core organization for research trials. While manual techniques have been developed to identify a cohort within a healthcare organization's electronic medical record (EMR), all rely on a physician or coder identifying and marking every record for every applicable medical condition. This manual process is inaccurate and only addresses the most common conditions. The suggested novel and revolutionary approach is to use big data techniques, utilizing the detailed unstructured narrative notes recorded on every patient for every encounter in every healthcare institution.  The core technology required to extract and make unstructured data usable in healthcare is natural language processing (NLP) combined with coded representations of clinical concepts (ontologies).

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes creating the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of data-driven healthcare.  Just as Google and Yahoo required advanced information extraction and search indexing techniques to make the vast amount of internet data usable, healthcare requires similar enabling technology.  The healthcare challenge is even more complex given the multitude of natural language descriptions used by physicians and the complex logic that defines potential cohorts and algorithms.  To address these issues, healthcare requires the category of technologies used in Google and Yahoo, but specialized for the healthcare domain.  In healthcare, quality improvement requires recognizing at risk cohorts in a population. Missing these cohorts and inadequately treating them can increase mortality by an order of magnitude, as in the case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in acute care. For quality measures being implemented by the federal government, defining and identifying cohorts is always the first step of tracking and reporting.

The aim of this research is to identify the role of culture, individual identity, epistemology and bi-cultural efficacy in this process. The guiding hypothesis is that AI-AN success in STEM is influenced by dynamics of culture, epistemology and individual identity, with the role of bi-cultural efficacy being particularly significant. The researchers are interested in knowing: (a) What factors positively influence AI-AN success in STEM?;  (b) What role do the dynamics of culture, epistemology and individual identity play in AI-AN success in STEM and how are these dynamics played-out in individual experience?;  and (c) Does bi-cultural efficacy play a role in this process, and if so, what is that role?

Results of this research will increase understanding of how AI-AN individuals leverage personal and cultural assets in a way that embraces a congruency between Indigenous culture (Native science) and Western science as they achieve success in STEM.  This information will contribute to the literature analyzing issues in AI-AN education and under-representation in STEM and indicate directions for future research. Most importantly, this research may lay the foundation for increasing the proportion of AI-AN scientists.  Factors that contribute to success and achievement of AI-AN in STEM are often unrecognized, underappreciated or poorly understood.  The improved coherence of interventions that will result from better conceptualization of the strengths and needs of AI-AN students will provide a roadmap for developing best-practice and model-driven programming within universities, improve AI-AN educational outcomes in STEM, and in turn, contribute to improvements in AI-AN individual and community well-being.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The FOXP2 gene encodes a transcription factor that controls the expression of many downstream genes, which in turn play important roles in neural circuit development and synaptic plasticity. Mutations in the human FOXP2 gene cause severe speech and language disorders. Thus studies of the regulation of the FOXP2 gene provide a novel window into the molecular mechanisms of language development. Sequence analysis has identified several miRNAs that target FOXP2 3?-UTR. It is hypothesized that miRNAs regulate FOXP2, and via FOXP, play a role in vocal development. This hypothesis will be tested in the zebra finch animal model using a combination of molecular, cellular, and behavioral approaches. Results of the work will establish a new post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for FOXP2 expression. Because both the FOXP2 gene and miRNAs are highly conserved through evolution, insights gained from these experiments are highly relevant to understanding the roles of miRNAs in the development and evolution of human language.     Carrying out the work will provide opportunities to train students in neuroscience research with a multidisciplinary approach. A combined effort of teaching, mentoring students, and conducting community outreach activities will disseminate progress in neuroscience to students, improve scientific literacy among the public, and nurture the future generation of scientists.

One in five women has been hurt by intimate partners in their lifetimes. Among them, 42 percent receive injuries and 12 percent require medical care.  Victims have more frequent hospitalizations and more visits to emergency departments, outpatient clinics, and mental health services.  Despite the devastating impact that husband-to-wife abuse has on the wives and society, there are many unresolved questions, including how women subjected to violence arrive at decisions to leave or continue their relationships. To improve understanding of the dynamics of women's decision making in violent relationships, this study will document daily patterns of violent events, perceived need for action, and the potential predictors of action over a 2-month period for each woman. The study will recruit 150 adult women attending routine office visits at six primary care clinics. Women who report abuse within the past month will complete a baseline interview and a daily telephone survey for 2 months. Daily questions will address the previous day's violence (events, stalking, perceived escalation), household environment (alcohol, stress, closeness, forgiveness), concerns (children, their safety, financial independence), perceptions (desire to ""move on"" or ""keep the family together"", ability to control violence), and perceived need for action (leaving, coping assistance, legal assistance). Weekly telephone discussions, and end-of-study qualitative and quantitative interviews will assess additional decision making factors and women's sense of safety during the study. In addition, subjects will complete baseline and end-of-study assessments of factors that may modify perceived need for action or its translation into actual action.      This work advances our understanding about decision making in violent relationships by applying innovative methods to study the variability of women's decision making. This line of inquiry could have significant clinical applications, guiding possible interventions, by identifying factors important in decision making to abused women and explaining the variability of decision making in violent relationships. In addition, this study advances discovery and understanding by joining research and teaching, integrating project results into a workshop series for medical students by promoting novel research methods. Key innovative features include real-time reports of violent events, decision making and triggers, use of cellular phones in data collection, and assessment of day-to-day dynamics. Study results are broadly disseminated in journal publications, national professional meetings, and multidisciplinary conferences attended by policymakers and investigators. The study team has partnerships with federal agencies (i.e. the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), and is informing policy development through organizations such as the American Academy of Family Physicians.

While mammary developmental biologists have gathered a wealth of molecular and cellular data, fundamental questions remain. For example, it is still unknown how cells of various types become organized into a duct. How is the organization affected by system perturbations such as altered signaling processes? The answers to these questions rely on an understanding of signaling and behavioral ""rules"" governing normal ductal morphogenesis and maintenance. Experimental investigations of these interactions, complemented by mathematical models, can help facilitate the understanding and definition of these rules. In this project, the investigators employ a joint experimental and mathematical modeling approach to study mammary gland development with a focus on ductal morphogenesis. With respect to cellular and tissue level parameters, the investigators design specific experiments to measure model parameters and validate model results. Particular emphasis will be placed on the nature of the signaling vs. receiving cell type(s). In parallel, the complementary expertise will be leveraged and used to develop a multiscale mathematical and computational framework to bridge the gap between tissue scale models of ductal morphogenesis and cellular scale models with detailed cell arrangements. This integrative project will allow for predicting what occurs in response to system perturbations such as loss-of-function due to mutations or epigenetic events. This can provide insight on the emergence of abnormal development programs and the initiation of tumors. The methods developed here will be applicable to modeling other organs with branching architectures such as lung, salivary, olfactory epithelium and prostate glands. Beyond these applications, the new tools developed here will also impact other problems in the biological sciences including development of other tissues and organs, wound healing, and tissue regeneration that are characterized by processes occurring in concert over a wide range of space and time scales.       One of the fundamental questions in biology is how tissues and organs develop and become organized. Developmental processes are the result of complex mechanical and signaling processes occurring inside and outside cells, and between cells and the environment. Such complex processes are very difficult to understand by using conventional experiment-based approaches alone. Recently, it has been recognized that mathematical modeling can provide a unique and complementary tool to experimental investigations by generating experimentally testable hypotheses, and that an integrated experimental and computational approach can potentially be more powerful than solely using experimental investigation, in identifying mechanisms responsible for non-intuitive developmental behavior frequently observed in experiments. However, the developmental processes involve interactions across a wide range of spatial and temporal biological scales. Thus, new mathematical models describing biological behavior at different scales, and at different levels of complexity, should be developed, linked together, and experimentally validated to provide a theoretical predictive framework to complement current developmental biology research. This is precisely what this project will address in the context of the mammary gland, for which it is still unknown how the cells of various types become organized and how this organization is affected by perturbations to the system such as from mutations. Specifically, these questions will be addressed by drawing on the complementary expertise of the researchers in mathematical and computational modeling and in experimental techniques to create and analyze a multiscale modeling framework for mammary gland development. The parameters in the models will be measured, and the models will be validated, using specifically designed experiments. The integrative work presents a necessary first step towards further development of a comprehensive, multiscale computational framework capable of accurately predicting the development of normal and abnormal mammary gland morphologies.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The overall idea is to use a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)with multiple acceptors. From our simulations and preliminary measurements we determined that the proposed multiple acceptor systems will provide energy transfer efficiencies that allow precise estimations of site-to-site distances of well over 100 Å. Using these systems, it was possible to reveal precise donor-to-horde of acceptors distances for systems with a DNA-avidin. We plan to apply both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques to further increase the accuracy of site-to-site distance measurements. Additionally, molecular/cellular Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy(FCS) will be utilized. These methods are particularly useful in applications using extremely low concentrations of substrates and detected analytes. In order to predict and analyze the data for long FRET measurements, theoretical models will be developed. First, for a quick data analysis, a simple model will be established assuming a random distribution of acceptors on a sphere and a single donor. This will be followed by a Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) based model to predict the intensity decays of the donor and acceptor for various numbers and distributions of interacting fluorophores. As a primary application of the long FRET strategy we propose developing an immunoassay for a celiac disease. This bioassay requires detection of site-to-site distances longer than 100 Å. A method allowing for easy, non invasive detection of this sickness has the potential to eliminate significant, unnecessary pain for a great many individuals.    General Abstract: The goal of this proposal is to develop more sensitive biosensors that work based on appearance of fluorescence upon binding of the target molecules.  Such biosensors are often based on the fluorescence phenomenon where presence of two fluorophores cause quenching of signal and separation of these fluorophores causes for signal to come on.  This proposal will develop a better fluorescence based system for biosensor development.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Mn undoubtedly played an important role during Earth?s transition from an anoxic to an oxic planet being the key catalyst in oxygenic photosynthesis as well as the metal cofactor for key enzymes involved in oxygen metabolism. In this project we propose to study an active Mn oxide-depositing hot spring in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) as a possible analog of early Earth. In most contemporary near neutral pH environments Mn-oxidizing microorganisms are believed to be the primary catalysts for Mn oxide formation. Such Mn-oxidizing microorganisms typically encase themselves with Mn oxide minerals producing distinct structures that may be preserved in geologic deposits. While molecular oxygen is required for Mn-oxidation, only trace amounts are needed, because the source of reduced Mn is from oxygen depleted environments. Mn oxidizing microorganisms are thus typically found in the transition zone between the oxic and anoxic regions.  Preliminary results of the Ph.D. graduate student this project supports has revealed the presence of ancient and unique Bacterial lineages and the occurrence of Archaea in one of the YNP hot springs.  Research will characterize this hot spring ecosystem examining the water chemistry, Mn mineral deposits, microbial mats/biofilms and microbial diversity and functionality in an effort to gain a better understanding of these novel microbial communities their metabolic basis of growth and survival in the hot spring.  Approaches will employ geological, chemical, microscopic, microbiological and molecular microbial ecological methods.

Autograft and allograft based products are currently used for repair purposes and have several limitations including suboptimal strength, possible negative immune effects and risks of disease transmission. The new technologies and proposed products overcome the drawbacks posed by autografts and allografts.  These new product technologies are potentially stronger, bioactive, more biocompatible and completely degradable while being ideally suited for load-bearing bone healing and soft tissue repair and regeneration applications. There are estimated to be over 1 million bone graft implants performed each year throughout the world. Production costs for the proposed technologies will be in the range of $500 per implant, yielding a $2000 net profit per implant. Our objective in the first 3 years is to achieve a 2% market share of bone grafts (20,000 grafts) which would provide $40 million in revenue per year. Every year, 400,000 rotator cuff repair procedures performed in the US require the use of a tendon augmentation device. Production costs are $1,000 per implant, yielding a $4000 profit per implant. We conservatively believe that 30% of repair operations would benefit from our soft tissue regeneration system (120,000 repairs) and that a 10% market share would be 12,000 repairs. This translates to a profit of 48 million per year.     In order to move these technologies to commercialization, we have categorized different products into short-term, mid-term and long-term time frames spanning 1 to 5 years. Short-term products include grafts fabricated from the materials alone without inclusion of any biologics. The short-term products, classified as devices or implants, create a short route to 510k FDA clearance (approval).  An ample financial base from the aforementioned products will allow re-investment of R & D efforts toward the commercialization of subsequent products or to pursue an out-license or acquisition exit after subsequent 510k approvals. The strong patent portfolio and constant revenue from the initial product commercialization will create a self-sustainable academic centered innovation ecosystem. All these activities will ensure workforce development, create new jobs and businesses, and foster economic development.     Third party partnerships engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include technology niche analysis, business plan development, and initiation of new startup ventures for existing products and new products. The potential economic impact is expected to approximate 100 million per year in the next 2 to 3 years which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the orthopaedic device fixation, repair, and regeneration market.    Societal impact short term, the proposed devices successfully address issues and drawbacks related to biological grafts currently used and will improve treatment efficiency/cost, enhance patient compliance and contribute to a better quality of life.

Intestinal edema refers to the excess accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces of the intestinal wall tissue.   The project focuses on two separate scales. At the continuum scale, the intestinal layer is modeled as an inhomogeneous poroelastic medium that undergoes finite deformation.  Intestinal transit is modeled as  Navier-Stokes flow within the intestinal cavity and is coupled to the intestinal wall model in a fluid-structure interaction algorithm.  Coupling conditions include the continuity of normal fluid flux, the balance of forces and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition, across the interface between the lumen and intestinal layer.  At the microscale, a detailed biochemical-mechanical mathematical model of a smooth muscle cell is developed.  The model focuses on the regulation of myosin light chain and its phosphorylation, which have been linked to intestinal muscle contractility. Experimental data from both animal and cell models are to be incorporated into the development of the mathematical models at both scales.    Intestinal edema can arise in patients with gastroschisis, inflammatory bowel disease and cirrhosis, as well as in patients receiving resuscitative fluid treatments after traumatic injuries. The main problem for a patient with intestinal edema is that the condition causes ileus, a decrease in intestinal transit due to decreased intestinal smooth muscle contractility.  Decreased intestinal transit often leads to longer hospital stays and recovery times for patients and in extreme cases can be fatal.  The link between edema and ileus is unknown, and is thus the motivation for developing mathematical models to explore this phenomenon. Results from this project will improve understanding of edema formation and its effect on intestinal muscle contractility and intestinal transit.  The models will be utilized to simulate treatment scenarios to assist experimentalists with their goal of preventing ileus when edema forms.  There are only a few drugs available to treat ileus; they have limited effectiveness and all target the enteric or central nervous system.

This bone substitute product is designed to possess injectability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity properties as well as structural and mechanical integrity. This bone substitute product is sufficiently flexible to fill cavities with different geometries with closer packing compared to fixed-shape substitutes. This bone substitute product can be injected to the bone defects using minimally invasive procedures. Minimally invasive surgery tremendously reduces healthcare costs. Bone substitute products with all the above properties do not currently exist in the market.

The first two aims focus on determining whether turn-taking is solely determined by the current speaker or is negotiated by both conversants. The first aim measures how well human subjects, listening to excerpts of speech, can predict whether the current speaker will continue the turn or release it. The second aim analyzes timing lags at turn transitions. Many turn transitions have short lags, which favors a speaker-control model; however this might be an artifact of common speech act sequences, back channels, early onsets, and provisional turns. The third aim, using the findings of the first two aims, is to determine the cues and mechanisms that are used by conversants in taking the turn.    Better understanding of turn-taking in human-human dialogues is important as it will help in building more efficient and natural spoken dialogue systems, allowing the user and system to better collaborate to solve complex tasks. It should also allow spoken dialogue systems to deal with a broad range of users, from experts to novices: for experts, letting them take the initiative (and the turn), in order to efficiently complete the task, while guiding novices with more directions and examples.

Healthcare quality and cost represent top national priorities. An increasingly common strategy to improve outcomes and value of care is performance assessment to promote best practices. Over decades, the most successful quality improvement (QI) programs have been heavily data-reliant. These programs require identifying patients that fit specific quality measures and assuring their care meets national guidelines. Linking patients to quality measures is the rate limiting step, involving an overwhelming amount of manual labor to review narrative notes one at a time and link them to an appropriate subset of hundreds of known quality measures. Leveraging a robust platform proven in Phase I, the proposed Phase II solution offers an automated approach to capturing a set of quality measures in real-time. The output will provide rich and compliant documentation enhanced with quality measures that feed the electronic health record (EHR) and downstream clinical, operational, and financial hospital systems through standard protocols. The goal is a disruptive change that will fast-track national initiatives and enable a safer and more efficient healthcare system.    The broader/commercial impact of this program is to further national healthcare goals of reducing cost and improving quality in care. The approach leverages increased breadth, depth, and accuracy of patient data captured at the point of care. The most aggressive national initiatives encourage capturing a small portion of the hundreds of known quality measures. Accelerating capture and use of quality measures is an opportunity to meaningfully improve a healthcare system that lags in quality and cost. Impact must also be considered at a personal level. There is a cost to care within a system where quality is not documented and tracked. A typical example out of the hundreds of defined measures is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Multiple studies on manual programs to document VAP and leverage care algorithms demonstrate greater than 40% reduction in mortality and 20% reduction in cost. VAP, though common, did not make the top 15 list of measures required by the government in 2014 because it is too difficult to capture.

Tratnyek  Oregon Health & Science University    There are many established and emerging water treatment technologies based on granular materials that remove contaminants by reduction. These technologies range from reactive barriers of iron metal that degrade chlorinated solvents in groundwater to filters containing iron oxides that remove arsenic from drinking water. Ongoing efforts are advancing these technologies on all fronts, mostly through ad hoc testing of novel reducing materials on common contaminants or testing of novel contaminants with common reducing materials. However, there are not yet any general metrics or models that can be used to advance these technologies by taking advantage of their common characteristics. Such tools would facilitate process optimization and enable quantitative performance assessment for comparison of competing alternatives or rational design of novel reducing materials. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a flexible, quantitative, and powerful diagnostic approach to characterizing the reactivity of all types of granular reducing materials used in water treatment systems. Part of the project will involve measuring contaminant degradation in conventional bench-scale reactors using a wide variety of potentially useful reducing particulate materials (granular metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, etc.). However, most of the experimental work will focus on developing advanced electrochemical methods for characterizing the materials based on a newly developed method for forming the particles into electrodes. The results obtained by this electrochemical approach will be applied to better understand the fundamental processes controlling the performance of reducing materials for water treatment and to provide data for quantitative models that can be used to predict the performance of new, as yet untested, materials. Preliminary predictions made using these models will be tested experimentally to validate the models and demonstrate their practical utility.    Access to clean water requires methods to remove a variety of contaminants, and this project aims to improve on the water treatment methods that are currently available. The focus of this project is on chemical contaminants, but the treatment methods under investigation can also serve to control other types of contaminants, such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses, etc. In addition to the identification of new/better reducing materials for water treatment, and the development of systematic methods for identification and optimization of materials for water treatment, this project also will initiate a novel partnership with training programs for water treatment industry professionals to maximize the impacts of this and future research and development projects.

With the influx of new details about the higher-level structure and dynamics of the genome, novel techniques will be required to visualize and model the full extent of genomic interactions to gain insight about genome functions.   Current genome browsers are specifically aimed at viewing primary sequence information.  Although supplemental information can be annotated via new tracks, representing structural hierarchies and interactions is quite difficult in these browsers, particularly across non-contiguous genomic segments.   In addition, in spite of many recent efforts to measure and model the genome structure at various resolutions and detail, little work has focused on combining these models or taken advantage of the large amount of genomic and epigenomic data generated from new high-throughput approaches. To address these issues, the team has created a proof-of-concept interactive 3D viewer, Genome3D, to enable integration and visualization of genomic and epigenomic data in three dimension.  Substantial development is needed to take advantage of the newest genomic technologies and to enable its integration with analysis pipelines.  While enormous amount of spatial information for eukaryotic chromosomes have been generated, the size and complexity of these data require the design and development of new algorithms and methods in data integration and model construction. The goal is to develop a full-fledged, platform independent system that enables biologists to build and refine their own 3D genome models to analyze their data.      The intellectual merits of the research include: 1) Implementing a novel strategy to employ new engines with strong interactive design element to transform the prototype into a cloud-based 3D genome browser that can be used on various platforms including web browsers and tablets, making 3D structural genome information available to a broader research community. 2)  Adding integrated tools that can analyze 3D features of genomes and support model building and validation. 3) Designing and providing robust set of APIs and scripting for customized data analysis.  4) Collaborating with other researchers to explore and visualize new three dimensional genome models.    There are a number of broader impacts in this research.  A multi-scale three dimensional genome browser is crucial to achieve fuller understanding of genome functions and will provide a new way to teach genomics.  Exploring genomes through 3D visualization will significantly advance genome research and will have a profound impact on comparative genomics and genetics. The use of new user interaction-intensive engines into scientific research tools and will encourage researchers in every area to use interactive visualization to analyze data.  New  algorithms to analyze models and visualize genomic information can be extended to problems of similar size in other fields and form the basis for new computational approaches.

The Science Gateway Platform (SciGaP) project will create a set of hosted infrastructure services that can be easily adopted by gateway providers to build new gateways based on robust and reliable open source tools. The proposed work will transform the way Science Gateways are constructed by significantly lowering the development overhead for communities requiring access to cyberinfrastructure, and support the efficient utilization of shared resources.

These ""living fossils"" construct protective shells using sediment grains held together by adhesive substances that they secrete. During shell construction, agglutinated forams display amazing properties of selection - for example, some species build their shells of clear quartz grains, while other species use only grains of a specific size. Understanding how these single cells assemble complex structures may contribute to nanotechnology by enabling people to use forams as ""cellular machines"" to aid in the construction of nano-devices. This project will analyze the genomes of at least six key foram species, and then ""mine"" these genomes for technologically useful products and processes. The project will focus initially on the adhesive materials forams secrete, which may have wide application in biomedicine and biotechnology. Furthermore, the work will further develop a molecular toolkit which could open up new avenues of research on the physiology, ecology, and population dynamics of this important group of Antarctic organisms. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists.

The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.     The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications. Specifically, the transition from paper records to EHRs has accelerated significantly since the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009. The Act provides monetary incentives for the ""meaningful use"" of EHRs. As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public's fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms.

The focus will be on girls in grades 4-8, critical years when they face transitions from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school. This effort will ultimately lay the foundation for improving math learning for girls and expand their participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and careers.  The project will address two of the four core areas identified by the EHR Core Research program: STEM Learning and Broadening Participation in STEM.    The project is based on two key concepts: the importance of girls' math identity to their participation and persistence in STEM; and the importance of building a network of researchers and practitioners through the establishment of a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) to increase understanding and knowledge about girls' math identity. Math identity is an important element within the larger context of academic identity and achievement.  Students who value the power of their minds--their academic identity--also take pride in belonging to their learning community; are comfortable speaking up and actively engaging in the learning that takes place in that community; and contribute to the building of a learning community through their engagement as learners and teachers of each other (Snipes, Fancsali & Stoker, 2012). The existing literature on the development of girls' math identity also states the importance of the classroom as a community of learners and the need to create learning environments that foster self-efficacy and agency which is supported by mastery of the subject matter (Boaler, 2002; Bevan, 2011; Boaler, William & Zevenbergen, 2000).     This project will bring interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners together to define common research goals and priorities around girls' math identity by establishing a Network Improvement Community (NIC) and holding a hybrid on-line and in-person conference of researchers and practitioners. The NIC will take a problem-centered approach, bringing necessary expertise, commitment, and a social arrangement to the task of improving STEM learning and broadening girls' participation in STEM education and careers. Graduate students and emerging researchers will participate in the conference and become part of the NIC and potential collaborators on future work. Although the primary focus of the project is research, participating practitioners will ensure that research in this area has a direct link to the improvement of formal and informal practice.

Secreted proteins of the Wnt family represent one such signal. Wnts elicit precise changes in gene expression mediated by increased levels of the protein ?beta-catenin. Too much or too little signal leads to tissue defects and disease.     While it is known that Wnts activate cell surface receptors, it remains unclear where on the cell membrane or inside the cell the ligand-activated receptor functions, how it activates the intracellular signaling cascade via the protein Dishevelled and how the receptor is turned off. This proposal addresses these questions directly with a novel in vivo approach. In addition, it will identify how Dishevelled blocks the central regulator in the pathway, a protein complex assembled around the scaffold protein Axin, and is expected to identify in vivo how the receptor-initiated signal leads to the inhibition of the Axin complex and induces beta-catenin signaling, a process that remains controversial.     Broader Impact  Our understanding of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has increased dramatically in recent years. However, many findings are derived from in vitro experiments and their functional significance is limited. The signaling events of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are amenable to investigation in their normal cellular context using the Drosophila model system, underscoring the significance of the studies proposed here. These investigations are expected to identify dynamically changing interactions as the signal is transduced, thereby greatly increasing our understanding of this important signaling mechanism.

Recent laboratory studies have shown that nitrophenols formed from the dark reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with surface adsorbed polyphenolic compounds and the subsequent photolysis of surface-adsorbed nitrophenols may be a substantial source of HONO. But wavelength-dependent HONO yields, from the photolysis of the adsorbed nitrophenols, have not been characterized.  This work will quantify photochemical HONO and the OH quantum yields from heterogeneous and gas phase photolysis reactions using laser photolysis combined with cavity ring-down spectroscopy and determine the UV/visible absorption cross sections of surface-adsorbed NO3 and nitrophenols as a function of wavelength using Brewster angle cavity ringdown spectroscopy. Additional experiments will provide data on the absorption cross sections of gas phase nitrophenols and HONO yields from nitrate and 2-nitrophenol adsorbed on surfaces that serve as surrogates for various environmentally relevant surfaces.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This project develops new technology that can address the minute size of the neurons, and the vast amount of data generated by neural activity. This project leverages the collaborative environment between Rice and Texas Medical Center to develop novel electrical stimulation approaches to modulate the seizure network, adaptively and selectively. If successful, the end result would be a reparative therapy that leverages inherent brain plasticity mechanisms and may one day be independent of chronically implanted electronics.    This project develops algorithms that capture the dynamic, frequency dependent connectivity of the brain from real-time monitoring of the brain using ECoG (Electrocorticography) and then identifying the ""optimal"" parameters of the LFS (low-frequency electrical stimulation) to modulate the connectivity of the epilepsy network with temporal and spatial precision. The complexity of modeling such connectivity in real-time is managed by first segmenting neural activity into different epochs and spectral bands and then deriving the sparse connectivity in each of the segments. Effective connectivity in each spectral-temporal segment is estimated using Granger causality. LFS is applied after detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) at spatial locations identified from the model. These critical steps lead to the development of a prototype system of real-time stimulation with a natural trade-off of complexity versus accuracy prompting a compromise between battery life and efficacy. The efficacy of spatially-optimized, activity-triggered LFS is evaluated by measuring the irritability of the seizure network and comparing the rate of IEDs detected during pre- and post-treatment periods. These experiments would point the way to treatment of pharmacologically refractory epilepsy without surgical resection of brain tissue and lead to reparative therapies leveraging inherent brain plasticity. The proposed methodology presents the first of its kind reparative, real-time, and selective network modulation to treat a debilitating disease.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

In the face of changing diets and a rapidly growing elderly population, there is exceptional need for better understanding of the mechanisms of brain metabolism and its effects on the brain. Although this project is designed to address a basic research question, the results have obvious implications for disorders of the brain due to altered metabolism. The work done in this project takes a unique approach to examine an understudied aspect of cognition, and has the potential to shift the focus of neuroscience research in a new direction. In addition, educational benefits include the participation of two undergraduate and two high school research interns through collaboration with a local high school and the HHMI sponsored Scholars Program through Lewis and Clark University. A high school student joins the laboratory from the Saturday Academy. A team of two HHMI sponsored undergraduates and two high school students work together on aspects of this project under the guidance of the PI during the summer. Community education on issues such as the role of cholesterol in brain function are fostered through the Healthy Aging Alliance, a program in which researchers join the public for presentations of their work and discussions on healthy aging. The PI also participates in Let's Get Healthy, an outreach program focused on encouraging healthy habits in middle and elementary school children in underserved communities. Research collaboration and outreach in undertreated areas of rural Oregon are promoted by the Central Oregon Research Coalition.    The scientific objective of this project is to investigate the interaction between apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as a modulator of brain metabolism, anxiety and cognition. The PI hypothesizes that compared to apoE2 and apoE3, apoE4 acts as an ""aging accelerator"" via interaction with the LDLR, causing alterations in brain metabolism that lead to cognitive and behavioral changes. The PI-team tests this hypothesis by examining anxiety and cognitive function, as well as determining brain ""metabolic profiles?"", in mice that express human apoE isoforms and human LDLR. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its integrative systems biology approach: the aims merge detailed behavioral and cognitive analyses with unbiased metabolomic profiling. The plan is hypothesis driven, and is based on evidence from both the cardiovascular and neuroscience fields. The project is a creative combination of metabolomics and behavioral neuroscience, and employs a unique animal model to study a crucial proteinprotein interaction in the brain for the first time. The PI received graduate training at the University of North Carolina from two pioneers in the fields of lipoprotein biology and genetics. The Sponsoring Scientist has an established track record in neuroscience and specializes in complex behavioral analyses in animal models, in particular measurements of anxiety and learning and memory in mice.

The substances formed in this oxidation are various forms of manganese oxide. These minerals are some of the strongest oxidants found in the environment and play important roles in both a biological and a geological sense. They are often called ""scavengers of the sea"" because of their great ability to absorb toxic substances. The chemical details of the biological oxidation of manganese ions and formation of manganese oxides by enzymes are not yet elucidated. The research of Dr. Tebo and Dr. Spiro examines the role of a specific enzyme, multicopper manganese oxidase, or MCO, that is derived from a bacterium that lives in the ocean. In previous research, the investigators were able to isolate the enzyme and, in the process, found that additional proteins seem necessary for the manganese oxidation. The current research addresses the nature of these newly discovered ""helper"" proteins and the chemistry catalyzed by MCO and the helper proteins; the results can be used to shed light on how the bacterium converts manganese in seawater to how the mineral exerts its important role in detoxifying seawater. The work impacts our understanding of several areas of science including oceanography, geology, biology and biochemistry. Another broad impact is through the inclusion of students at all educational levels, including high school, in the research. The investigators disseminate insights obtained from research to the general public through a science-in-art project.    A collaborative approach involving the two groups from different universities is being used to study the mechanism of bacterial manganese Mn(II) oxidation and manganese oxide production by the multicopper Mn oxidase (MCO) from Bacillus sp. PL-12. The formation of manganese oxide by bacterial oxidation of dissolved Mn(II) is important in aquatic and soil environments and is a key pathway in the global Mn cycle, which supports life through the Mn catalytic centers of many enzymes. This process has received increased technological interest because it leads to highly-reactive, nanoparticulate minerals, which can break down organic molecules and adsorb other metal ions, thereby controlling the distribution and bioavailability of many toxic and essential elements. An interdisciplinary effort using tools from chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics is being used to elucidate the mechanism of manganese oxidation by MCO. The biochemical mechanism by which this oxidation, as well as MnO2 mineralization, occurs is poorly understood.  Multicopper oxidase enzymes have been implicated as catalysts for the Mn(II) oxidation in many model systems for Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria, including the recently purified Mn oxidase complex from Bacillus sp. PL-12.  In this project, the structure and mechanism by which the Mn oxidase complex from Bacillus sp. carries out two sequential one-electron oxidation steps and mineralizes Mn is being elucidated. The specific objectives of the research are: 1) to characterize the copper centers of the Mn oxidase complex; 2) to determine the course of Mn oxidation and oxygen entry; 3) to characterize polynuclear intermediates formed on the pathway to MnO2; 4) to describe the role of ancillary proteins required for the expression of the active complex; and 5) to elucidate the structure of the enzyme complex and emerging oxides. X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic methods are being used in conjunction with basic biochemistry techniques to achieve these objectives.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

In all eukaryotes, the genome is compacted into the nucleus through the formation of condensed molecules known as chromatin. The smallest individual units of compaction are known as nucleosomes that are comprised of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of small basic histone proteins. In order for regulatory factors and enzymes to access the genetic code and properly regulate processes essential for normal development and cell survival, the nucleosomes need to be moved aside or directly modified on specific amino acid residues in a process termed chromatin remodeling. The enzymes and other proteins that carry out chromatin remodeling are ancient and remarkably conserved, with increasing complexity from single celled organisms up through vertebrates. The overall impact of this project will be a better understanding of how chromatin remodeling controls expression of the information that is encoded within the genome. In addition, high school, undergraduate and graduate students will participate in mentored research. Women and minorities will be highly represented. Multidisciplinary training and education are vital to prepare for diverse science careers and this project employs the unique tools currently available for Drosophila studies. Students will be trained in molecular and developmental genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and bioinformatics, structural and developmental biology. The project will enhance interactions among faculty scientists within the institution and with students at multiple undergraduate institutions to explore the rapidly emerging field of bioinformatics. Undergraduate students will be tasked with learning new informatics tools and approaches using experimental data derived from this project.     In order to define the histone recognition and binding properties of Cmi and related mammalian domains and elucidate the potential mechanism of COMPASS-like complex targeting to gene enhancers, collaborative structural studies that include X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance of the histone recognition domains and targeted mutagenesis combined with in vitro measurements of binding affinities and in vivo chromatin association will be employed. The project also uses next-generation high throughput chromatin and RNA analyses (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq) and target gene studies. ChIP-Seq using chromatin from cmi mutant animals will enable correlation of epigenetic marks with Cmi function and align the RNA-Seq gene expression data with chromatin binding to address key developmental functions. Tissue-specific targeted removal of both cmi and trr and overexpression of cmi using unique genetic tools developed for these studies will allow for direct testing of COMPASS-like functions on target genes. Leading edge chromatin technologies that examine physical connections between distant gene regions will elucidate novel regulatory roles for the Drosophila COMPASS-like complex in facilitating enhancer-promoter communication necessary for proper gene control. These studies will help to reveal essential and foundational properties of chromatin remodeling and modifying complexes and provide critical insight into the mechanisms of developmental gene regulation.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Dr. Linda Roman from the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio and Dr. Jung Ja Kim from the Medical College of Wisconsin to develop probes for and undertake an investigation of the mechanism of nitric oxide synthases.  The nitric oxide synthases (NOS) generate nitric oxide (NO), which plays key roles in many physiological processes. The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) generates NO in the cardiovascular system, where it is a potent vasodilator.  Similarly, the neuronal isoform (nNOS) is involved in neurotransmission and skeletal and cardiac muscle function, and the inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in response to an immune challenge.  The investigators will study the mechanism of function of these enzymes with the use of customized photoactivatable probes. The ability to modulate the activities of these enzymes will help elucidate their physiological roles and regulation, as well as give insight into their mechanisms.  This pursuit will allow undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in protein expression, purification, characterization, and in the use of X-ray diffraction to determine the protein structure.  Specific compounds that bind to the NOSs will also be designed to help achieve these goals, exposing trainees to synthetic chemistry techniques.    This project focuses on the use of novel photoactivatable NADPH analogues, called nanotriggers (NTs), targeted to the NADPH site of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and cytochrome P450 reductase (POR), to elucidate the mechanism of electron transfer through these enzymes as well as stabilize them in a closed conformation, facilitating crystallization. This project will: (1) determine the X-ray structure of various NT-protein complexes; (2) elucidate time-resolved structure/function studies of the first catalytic steps by kinetics studies in solution and time-resolved X-ray crystallography; (3) design novel isoform-specific eNOS activators by in silico simulations; and (4) monitor eNOS trafficking in cells by biphotonic excitation, due to the intrinsic imaging properties and specificity of the NT probes. The photoactive tools to be developed and characterized can trigger a specific catalytic event upon irradiation with a laser pulse. The laser pulse occurs at zero time, allowing for synchronization of initiation of catalysis, which can be monitored in a time-resolved manner. This proposal will develop new tools for time-resolved studies of selected proteins that overcome the limitation of slow (greater than or equal to ms) diffusion of the probe by binding directly to the protein with the ability to trigger catalysis by ultrafast electron injection to the protein. This approach represents a new tool to synchronize an ensemble of enzymes in solution induced by a laser pulse and represents an alternative to single molecule studies.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The proposed novel flexible cathode electrode technology holds the key to commercialize high performance flexible batteries. If successful, the proposed research program will generate critical knowledge for fabricating a high-energy and high-power cathode for flexible energy storage device. It is anticipated that the proposed cathode electrode materials may improve the energy density of current state-of-the-art flexible battery at least by a factor of 5. The significant enhancement in energy density and power density makes the proposed technology attractive to new markets where flexible batteries hav not been widely used. Additionally, the proposed technique and concept may be used for manufacturing other multifunctional materials for a wide range of different applications.      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at the development of novel flexible cathode materials for flexible electronics. Mechanical strength of flexible electrodes is the most critical property. Traditional approach to achieve mechanically strong electrodes is to deposit active materials on a flexible carbon-based substrate, while the performance of resulting electrodes strongly are affected by the active material/substrate interface, which is often hard to fabricate and control.  The key innovation of the proposed research is a core-shell nano-architecture, in which a thin carbon layer is uniformly coated on the cathode nanofibers through an in-situ formation process. The core-shell nano-architecture design allows us to achieve enhanced mechanical strength, structural integrity, and electronic conductivity simultaneously.

These sites comprise numerous cold seeps and springs with bubbling waters containing carbon dioxide (CO2) that have proven to be very unusual in that they are also actively depositing Fe and Mn minerals, which in turn are harboring extensive microbial mat communities. The springs and seeps found within this unique watershed form along a salinity gradient with upstream being more freshwater while downstream has a tidally-driven marine influence. These habitats are sites where extensive microbial-mineral mounds (i.e., tufa deposits) form. Tufas as high as three meters are located along the length of both sides of Soda Bay Creek which drains into Soda Bay Estuary. The high flow systems are predominantly iron oxide deposition environments while the systems exhibiting low flow deposit manganese oxides. This project will investigate this unique watershed in an effort to describe the  biogeochemistry and geomicrobiology of Fe- and Mn-mineral formation along the physicochemical gradients from the upper creek to Soda Bay. Researchers hypothesize that the mounds are autotrophic ecosystems hosting microorganisms able to grow and fix CO2 from the energy captured from metal oxidation reactions. They propose to examine the microbial ecology of these ecosystems with two primary questions in mind. First, what are the metabolic processes these microbes use to capture energy and thereby feed themselves? Second, how might these microbial communities (fueled by mineral and CO2-rich fluids) change in response to the physicochemical gradients? Answers to these questions will allow them to address future important questions relating to whether these environments preserve traces of microbial fossils or biosignatures that can show a historical presence and thereby provide a glimpse into the past. This is a new and potentially transformative investigation as there is virtually no information regarding the impact of low-temperature Fe- and Mn-rich groundwater on freshwater or marine ecosystems, whether such systems contribute to carbon fixation and the carbon cycle, or the energetic or metabolic basis of the microbes supporting these ecosystems.    This project will partner with the Hydaburg School District. One of the researchers has built a longterm geoscience education and research program with the Hydaburg School District and Hydaburg Cooperative Association (tribal government) since 2008. The program involves 5th-12th grade science classes and teacher training with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of the geosciences. Interested students have the opportunity to participate in field sampling and will interact with scientists during trips to Soda Bay. This project is closely coupled with local tribal groups that have a long history with this site. Researchers will, in turn, routinely share their scientific discoveries with the tribal organization.    The project is well suited for EAGER support as it is exploratory in nature and potentially high impact. It will bring together multifaceted-technologies (e.g., aerial site survey, molecular biology, microscopy and geochemistry) in an effort to achieve a multi-scale understanding of this novel ecosystem potentially driven by metals as energy sources and where unique biogeochemical signatures will be preserved. Interpretation of such signatures in the geological record may provide new insights into important geological questions such as life in the ancient past, the role of microbes in the formation of metal ore deposits and even the evolution of life on Earth as the planet evolved from an anoxic to an oxic world.

Introductory physics for the life sciences (IPLS) courses are outdated and pre-medical education is perceived to be neither coherent nor well-structured. There is currently little research-validated teaching material available for undergraduate medical physics courses emphasizing the key physics concepts underlying clinical and biomedical research equipment.  There is general agreement that the science content in the current curriculum needs revision in order to improve the education of future healthcare professionals on relevant science competencies, skills, and learning habits.

Extensive formative and summative assessment will be completed to measure impacts on student learning with in-class assessment tools.  Formative assessment will be informed by the frequent and ongoing monitoring of student learning that provides rapid feedback to students on their performance.  Online free lecture questions will be designed as formative assessments to provide feedback for the instructor about their students' understanding of biomedical and physics content of the expert videos.  The course assessment involves several main activities that include the analysis of log data using the smartPhysics Framework (spF), pre-post-knowledge tests of individual modules and the complete Physics in Medicine course, a self-reflection assignment for students, classroom observations and videotaped exit interviews.  The effect of instruction on attitudes in all introductory general physics courses and Physics in Medicine will be investigated using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS), student surveys and videotaped focus group interviews.  Revisions to materials after each implementation will ensure effectiveness and research-validated content at the end of the funding.  Two intentional feedback loops providing data about the course materials will be built into the project.  The first will be an expert review of the course modules by advisory board members.

Such a tool has not been available until now due to multiple technical challenges that require sensitive and miniaturized sensors for detection of carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in breath with sub-second resolution and <1% accuracy, and would also require measurement of breath flow rate over a wide dynamic range under minimal flow resistance. To address these challenges, first, chemical sensors based on a hierarchical sensing material approach will be developed. This approach organizes sensing materials at different length scales, from nm to mm, into hierarchical structures to achieve fast and selective detection of the analytes. Second, to measure breath flow rate, a novel low-cost, power-free acoustic sensor will be developed, which converts breath into an acoustic signal that can be detected and analyzed with the built-in microphone of a cell phone.

This is an attractive option because elders prefer to live independently and report better health and quality of life when they do, and because aging in place can reduce the increasing costs of elder health care. However, aging in place still requires caregivers, and caregivers are in short supply. One approach to expanding the availability of caregivers for elders who are aging in place is to develop robots that can serve as caregivers in these homes. Research already suggests that many elders are open to this possibility, especially if it allows them to retain their independence. Furthermore, many elders report that for many tasks they would actually prefer to be helped by a robot rather than another human. As is the case for human caregivers, robot caregivers will be enmeshed in a larger complex social network and technical system beyond just the caregivers and the person who is being cared for. This larger context will need to be understood in order for robotic caregivers to successfully deliver the care that is needed, such as to know who to contact and with what information if the person that they are assisting is not following his or her usual patterns of behavior. This project will explore and describe how caregiving robots should function by analyzing the current form of caregiving in elders' homes, by creating a detailed account of current elder care practices, and by translating this account into design recommendations for caregiving robots.    The analysis will begin by describing the complex socio-technical context of current and future caregiving systems, specifically in terms of the work function and the work domain of the human or robot caregiver. Work function will be described independently of who or what will perform those functions. Work domain will be analyzed using a variety of techniques such as Abstraction-Decomposition Spaces (ADSs) and Contextual Activity Diagrams (ConADs). ADSs will map the relationships between a home's overall objectives and physical resources at several different levels of abstraction, such as by mapping the objective of providing a safe physical environment to different resources that are available to assist with transfers. ConADs will relate different work functions to different work situations, such as by relating the administration of medications to the appropriate time of day and location in the home. Based on these analyses of work function and work domain, the project will draft, refine, and validate formal descriptions of design requirements for caregiving robots.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This capacity provides the basis for how humans acquire speech and language, yet how the brain achieves this goal is unknown. Using an array of powerful techniques, this collaborative project will examine the anatomical, electrical, and molecular properties of brain circuits that control vocalizations in hummingbirds and songbirds, comparing them with each other and with prior human studies. Understanding how these different organisms evolved brain circuits to accomplish similar goals will reveal insights into fundamental properties of vocal learning systems.  Traditional lab animals cannot be used as they lack vocal learning; hence, the use of vocal learner birds is critical. The project will provide training in multiple research techniques to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, emphasizing underrepresented groups. It will also promote broad dissemination of findings and outreach activities, related to both scientific and conservation efforts. The project is also integrated with an International Consortium (funded by the Brazilian Government) for cataloguing and characterizing the diversity of tropical birds, including integration of Museum collections, generation of genome sequences, and examination of brain specimens relevant to the evolution of vocal learning. These activities will enable interactions between US and Brazilian faculty and students, while promoting training in molecular and histological methods through site visits, field trips, and workshops.    The vocal control system of songbirds is critical for song production and learning, and is well characterized anatomically, electrophysiologically, and molecularly. However, knowledge of the analogous areas in other avian vocal learners is limited. Recent phylogenomics efforts reveal that hummingbirds evolved vocal learning independently of songbirds; thus, comparing their vocal control systems will reveal convergently evolved features that may be fundamentally required for this trait. The investigators will use tract-tracing to determine how vocal control areas are connected in hummingbirds, in vitro electrophysiological recordings to determine intrinsic neuronal properties of vocal areas in hummingbirds and songbirds, and in situ hybridization to identify molecular markers of vocal nuclei. Evidence of shared anatomical, physiological and molecular specializations will point to convergent features representing possible universal properties of vocal learning systems that may also be shared with humans. Alternatively, differences would suggest that multiple circuit and cellular/molecular architectures can subserve vocal learning. Outcomes will provide novel clues as to evolutionary origins and constraints of vocal learning and associated pathways, leading to insights into fundamental requirements of vocal learning.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Protein channels that permit potassium ions to pass through neuron membranes are generally thought to quiet excessive neuron activity.  However, there is a growing list of examples indicating that these ""BK-type"" potassium ion channels may also increase neuron excitability. The fact that BK channels are expressed throughout the nervous system suggests that understanding such paradoxical effects is important for understanding brain function in general.  The investigators will record the activity of neurons in mice to learn the conditions that cause BK channels to quiet or excite neurons.  The results will be used to make computational models that predict the anti-excitatory or pro-excitatory behaviors of BK channels.  The project will train graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow to use state-of-art methods for studying brain function and anatomy and to make computational models, and will support the development of an integrated online virtual laboratory, ""The Ion Channel laboratory,"" to teach users about ion channels and the electrical excitability of neurons.      The mechanisms underlying how slow- and fast-gating BK channel types either depress or paradoxically enhance a neuron's likelihood for firing an action potential (AP) will be studied in dentate gyrus neurons of the hippocampus. Using wild type neurons that express slow-gating BK channels, and transgenic neurons (BK beta4 knockout) that express fast-gating channels, the investigators will directly measure the cause-and-effect relationship between BK-regulated AP shape, activation of spike-triggered bulk and local calcium, recruitment of interspike conductances, and AP frequency. These data will be used to generate a computational model of dentate gyrus neurons that predicts the context in which BK channels reduce or enhance neuronal excitability.  The model will then be experimentally tested in hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells and cerebellum purkinje neurons to determine if pro-excitatory effects uncovered in dentate gyrus neurons are features observed in other neuron types that express BK channels. The findings of this study will create new understanding and new neuronal computational models of spike-influenced conductance and its effect on intrinsic excitability.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

A prominent example is that of birds. Taking to the air enabled the dinosaurian ancestors of birds to exploit a range of ecological niches that now underlie the remarkable modern diversity of the group (approximately 10,000 living species). A significant part of this evolutionary success may have stemmed from the development of a relatively large brain, which has been considered necessary for coordinating the various, nuanced components of powered flight. This study complements the NSF BRAIN initiative by using a cross-disciplinary approach to understand the complex neurological evolution of birds and their dinosaurian relatives. To that end, an array of new techniques and new applications of existing technologies are employed to document the major changes in the brain associated with the origin of powered flight. This study also will establish a model of brain expansion complementing that already available for mammals. The outcome will be an unprecedented database of avian brain anatomy that includes not only imagery of morphological systems but also their relation to data generated through brain function.     The relationship between neuroanatomical, cognitive and behavioral evolution remains poorly understood, especially in deep time and across the vertebrate tree of life. This study addresses this relationship using a cross-disciplinary investigation of the evolutionary link between the large brain of living birds and the morphological changes that mark the transition from cursorial (running) dinosaur to flying bird. Initial steps use innovative imaging methods and novel staining techniques to generate the first data on what areas of the brain birds use while flying, and how this activity differs from that of other behaviors. These data will serve as a framework for a broad analysis of encephalization (increasing head size) within living birds and along the lineage where avian flight originated. Shared landmarks will be used to subdivide the endocranial cavity into functionally relevant partitions that allow testing for volumetric size changes between individual neural structures, including those most active during flight. This study also will use geometric morphometrics (anatomical comparisons) to assess covariation between neuroanatomical partitions and thus the presence of functionally and/or evolutionarily integrated regions of the brain. In short, the proposed study will generate data on how birds use their brain and apply those data to better understand the ancient relationship between brain evolution and the origin of the highly derived avian body plan.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

If the activity levels are too low or too high, the neurons can adjust the communication level between the neurons. The way that this is accomplished is not completely understood.

In this project, the researcher will investigate the role of these two proteins in regulating neuron communications. This work will lay the foundation for future studies in animals to understand how the brain adapts to visual experience or deprivation.  Adaptation to environmental light is important for daily life, so these studies will have broad impact on understanding vision in other animals, including humans.  The project will provide opportunities for a postdoctoral fellow, undergraduate, and high school students, including underrepresented minorities and women, to be trained in research in this EPSCoR state.

The impact of I-2 regulation by myosin light chain kinases (MLCK) via I-2 phosphorylation at serine 43 (Ser43) will be determined in the context of both PP1 function on PSD95 dephosphorylation at Ser295 and synaptic scaling. Using primary rat cortical neurons as a model system, the PI will apply bicuculline to enhance neuronal activity or tetrodotoxin (TTX) to decrease neuronal activity. I-2 will be knocked-down (KD) by expression of I-2 short hairpin RNA fragment RNA (ShRNA), and its effect on PSD95 phosphorylation at Ser295 will be examined by western blotting.

The previous two decades have witnessed the emergence and acceleration of a new paradigm in mathematical biology, which employs advanced methods in computational algebra and discrete mathematics toward modeling biological systems. In molecular biology in particular, rich libraries of gene regulation, protein-protein interactions and high-throughput gene expression profiling enable the construction of increasingly granular discrete models, which require the development and analysis of new algebraic and combinatorial techniques.  Whereas traditional methods in mathematical biology benefit from a robust infrastructure of journals, organizations, and conferences, such infrastructure for algebraic and combinatorial biology is still taking shape.  A core objective of this conference is to consolidate the ACSB as a national forum for the presentation, discussion, and integration of current work in the field.  ACSB 2015 will focus on diverse aspects of modeling of molecular networks, in particular gene regulatory networks, with an emphasis on discrete modeling approaches, including stochastic aspects of networks.

Tratnyek of the Oregon Health & Science University to investigate fundamental and applied aspects of how substances termed ""electron shuttles"" mediate redox reactions at solid-solution surfaces in the environment. Redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions are integral to many of the most important aspects of environmental chemistry, ranging from elemental cycling, to microbial fuel cells, to contaminant  fate and remediation. Many of these redox processes are known to be strongly influenced by natural and artificial electron shuttles, but the role of interfaces in electron shuttle effects is hard to characterize and poorly understood.  In additional to the laboratory research performed by graduate students, undergraduates, and high school interns, this project includes significant outreach activity with workshops for water industry professionals run by Clackamas Community College. One goal of these workshops is to better understand and utilize redox shuttle effects in the protection of safe drinking water.    The approach of this project is to use electrodes as model systems for environmental interfaces.  Electrodes are modified in various ways with electron shuttle compounds followed by measurement of redox processes using electrochemical instrumentation. The project scope includes different types of electrode materials (e.g., noble metals vs. iron oxide minerals), shuttle-electrode interactions (e.g., bonded vs. non-bonded), and shuttle types (quinones,  flavins, porphyrins, siderophores, etc.).

The PIs preliminary results show that the types of catalysts proposed to study can produce very rapid hydrodehalogenation of trichloroethene as well as hydrogenation of other model contaminants. In the proposed research, a green chemistry synthesis process will be developed. The link between catalyst structure and performance will be systematically investigated with catalysts designed to test specific catalytic mechanisms. Structures of Pd-M hybridized with both perfect graphene and defect-rich graphene in place of granular activated carbon will be modeled to determine the optimal surface structures, charge transfer mechanisms, electronic properties, and energetic distributions. The kinetics of contaminant reduction by such catalysts will be systematically quantified and a practical but rigorous kinetic model will be developed to compare these types of catalysts across a broad range of conditions. The sensitivity of these catalysts to inactivation by known poisons of noble metal catalysts (e.g., sulfide and chloride) common in water treatment will be evaluated and considered in optimization of the catalyst designs.

The traditional fields of applications have included genetics, agriculture, education, and surveys. Nowadays, new and challenging problems have emerged from such fields as business and health sciences, in addition to the traditional fields, to which methods of mixed model prediction are potentially applicable, but not without further methodology and computational developments. Some of these problems occur when interest is at subject level, such as personalized medicine, or (small) sub-population level, such as small communities, rather than at large population level. In such cases, it is possible to make substantial gains in prediction accuracy by identifying a class that a new subject belongs to. Other challenging problems occur when applying existing model search strategies in situations of incomplete or missing data, in model search or selection when prediction is of primary interest, and in making statistical inference based on the result of model search or selection. This collaborative research project aims at solving these challenging problems in prediction and model selection in situations of complex data, such as incomplete or missing data, and data that are correlated due to presence of random effects.    In this collaborative research project the PIs develop a novel statistical method, called classified mixed model prediction, to identify the subject class. This way, the new subject is associated with a random effect corresponding to the same class in the training data, so that the mixed model prediction method can be used to make the best prediction. Furthermore, the PIs develop a recently proposed method, called E-MS algorithm, for model selection in the presence of incomplete or missing data. The PIs also develop an idea called predictive model selection by deriving a predictive measure of lack-of-fit, and combining this measure with a recently developed class of strategies of model selection, called the fence methods. Finally, the PIs develop a unified Jackknife method to accurately assess uncertainty in mixed model analysis after model selection.

Its arrangement is fundamentally important for cell secretion, cell shape, growth, motility, and communication. Although the basic assembly of microtubules is well studied, very little is understood on how the array itself is organized. This is particularly important in multinucleated animal cells where multiple microtubule arrays are present and must maintain spatial separation so as not to interfere with each other. Establishing how these microtubule arrays are organized represents a fundamental challenge in understanding the basic organizational principles of eukaryotic cells. The preliminary data have identified multiple motor and cross-linker proteins that interact with microtubules and when deleted, result in broad alterations in array organization. The research plan is four fold: to understand at the cellular level where these effector proteins operate, to understand at the biochemical level how these effector proteins interact and function, to develop computational models that incorporate these activities and can predict/test understanding in multiple different scenarios, and to provide robust educational experiences to stimulate the next generation of scientists.

The study will examine the molecular level viral responses to ultraviolet irradiation to improve current ultraviolet light disinfection and design of future ultraviolet light technologies. The research aims to answer a number of fundamental questions around virus inactivation with ultraviolet light that can inform engineering practice, public health, and subsequent regulatory policy and thus has broad reaching impacts.    The proposed activity will advance knowledge in a number of key areas. New fundamental knowledge will be developed into the molecular-level response of viruses to ultraviolet light irradiation during disinfection practice. Specifically, in addition to adenoviruses, new studies will be performed on another double stranded DNA virus - JC polyomavirus - to test the generalizability of the findings with adenoviruses in response to low-pressure and medium-pressure ultraviolet light. This research will move beyond the traditional evaluations of laboratory strains of adenoviruses and isolate and test environmental strains to determine if there are any differences in the ultraviolet light -response that may be related to acclimated responses (such as DNA repair) from repeated exposure to and propagation in laboratory cell culture lines. A number of new areas in molecular microbiology methods, some of which we have developed, will be exploited including early stage infection inhibition due to specific ultraviolet light wavelengths, DNA repair from trans-lesion synthesis, protein damage assessment using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry techniques, and DNA damage using a new long range PCR technique we recently published. These fundamental findings will be used to develop a tailored wavelength ultraviolet-LED based energy efficient irradiation system to optimize disinfection at lower cost than conventional ultraviolet sources. The work proposed herein will: (1) evaluate inactivation kinetics and wavelength sensitivity of two double stranded DNA viruses,  (2) extend the adenovirus studies to adenoviruses isolated from the environment, (3) evaluate the fundamental role of DNA repair in the cell culture infectivity outcomes,  (4) incorporate newly developed molecular biology-based assays to assess DNA damage and protein damage from ultraviolet light irradiation at varying wavelengths, and,  (5) understand the implications for disinfection using tailored wavelength approaches made possible by the development of nanometer-specific ultraviolet light emitting diodes (LEDs). Regulators and public health officials need information to help make sound decisions for the public sector. The issue of virus disinfection for small systems is currently contentious as the Groundwater Rule specifically forbids the use of UV for any virus inactivation credit due to the high doses required for adenovirus inactivation that cannot currently be field-validated in UV reactors. Therefore, the timing of this research is critical if UV disinfection is going to play any role for virus disinfection in groundwater.

Effective navigation and action requires accurate visuomotor integration, or the use of visual information to guide movement. Visuomotor integration also requires attentional filtering to ensure that relevant information is processed, while irrelevant information is disregarded or suppressed. Few studies have examined visuomotor integration in naturalistic settings that allow measurement of both full-body motion and eye movement. The proposed project combines new technologies to investigate visuomotor integration in typical development and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is a clinical population with known visual and motor differences in the brain regions that support these systems and in functional performance. At present, most treatment approaches focus on social communication in a broad, qualitative manner without specific attention to the role of visual and motor functioning. This project quantifies differences in eye and body movements during imitative gesturing with a robot partner, as well as during other movements such as walking. By studying how visuomotor integration impacts movement and interaction with real and virtual objects, researchers gain a better understanding of the impact this skill has on higher-order features of ASD. This, in turn, aids in developing and delivering more targeted, evidence-based treatments. Quantitative approaches to measuring visuomotor integration skills also serve as an effective biomarker of ASD for early diagnosis, since visual and motor skills can be precisely measured earlier than social communication skills.     Recent innovations in eye tracking, robotics, and virtual reality have yielded technologies that can be integrated to study the interaction between visual, motor, and attentional systems in real-time. This project investigates visual, motor, and attentional processes in ASD and typical development to determine their relative contributions to accurate perception and action using virtual environments and human-robot interaction tasks that test visual and motor responses to object motion and imitative gesturing. The project aims include refining software used to analyze motion and eye data together by calculating gaze vector in a manner that accounts for head and body movement. This enables researchers to examine the strategies used by individuals with and without ASD when locating and tracking moving objects (e.g., preference for moving the head versus shifting gaze) or gestures (e.g., waving hand). In addition to head-eye integration, the project aims include measuring full-body motor responses to object motion. In order to comprehensively investigate imitative gesturing in the human-robot interaction tasks, the researchers use a new technique, Dynamic Time Warping, which allows examination of both spatial and temporal synchrony between a gesture modeled by the robot and the imitative movement generated by a participant. This novel approach to analysis may reveal important biomarkers of ASD related to visuomotor integration, which would not be evident in studies that examine only the spatial properties of imitative gesturing. The proposed project also advances methodological approaches via the development of new tools for data collection and analysis that are specifically suited to investigating perception and action in a naturalistic environment.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This concentration difference is used to drive many essential cellular processes and it is established and maintained by numerous membrane pumps, which are  proteins responsible for transporting these ions across the membrane. This project will engage undergraduate students (including members of minorities underrepresented in science) and graduate students in investigations of the fundamental properties by which a particular membrane pump selects and transports sodium and potassium ions across membranes. In addition to training in biophysical techniques, the students will be supported to attend national scientific meetings at which they will be able to present the results of their research.    The Na/K pump is electrogenic because it transports 3 Na+ out of the cell in exchange for 2 K+, in each catalytic cycle. One out of three sites can exclusively bind Na+ (a feature that distinguishes the Na/K pump from other P-type ATPases). All P-type ATPases alternate between two major conformations, E1 with inward facing ion binding sites and E2 with outward facing ion binding sites. The molecular mechanisms of ion selectivity by the Na/K pump remain unclear, yet knowledge of these is critical to an understanding of how these proteins couple the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to the mechanical work required for ion translocation. This project will study the mechanisms of ion selection in the Na/K pump with an innovative approach that integrates high-temporal-resolution electrophysiology, computational chemistry and biochemistry. The available crystal structures and results from our laboratory will be used to generate hypotheses with respect to (a) Elucidating the mechanisms of ion selectivity in the two major pump conformations; (b) Determining the order of intracellular Na+ binding and external Na+ release; and (c) Identifying the pathway and mechanisms of uncoupled H+ influx through Na/K pumps.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The project focuses on a large protein complex called Mediator, which selectively turns on subsets of genes in both yeast and mammalian cells.  Two central questions will be addressed.  First, how does Mediator select and turn on its gene targets?  Second, how does Mediator action in yeast compare to its action in mammalian cells?  The comparative approach used in this project will have broad impact on fundamental understanding of gene activity in ""simple"" yeast versus ""complex"" mammalian cells.  Some of the results will be in the form of ""big data""--large data sets that describe molecular interactions across an entire genome--and these will be deposited in public archives where they can be freely accessed by scientists and the public.  In addition, the project will provide training for undergraduates, a postdoctoral fellow, and two female graduate students, one of whom is a member of an underrepresented minority.    The Mediator protein complex consists of over twenty interacting proteins and is found in all cells with nuclei (eukaryotes).  Mediator is known to play a critical gene activating role via association with the machinery responsible for RNA synthesis (transcription).  However, how Mediator locates its gene targets and exactly what it does when it finds them, are not completely understood.  This project will address these issues in three aims.  The first will test the idea that proteins belonging to the general transcription machinery help Mediator to find its targets.  The approach will be to compare Mediator association with its targets in normal yeast cells and in mutants in which components of the general transcription machinery are impaired, using a method called ChIP-seq that identifies where proteins associate with DNA across an entire genome.  The second aim will follow up on previous results that suggested that Mediator association with different targets is related to differential dynamics--how fast Mediator finds its targets and how often and rapidly it leaves again. This idea will be tested using variations of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP, the basis of ChIP-seq) that provide information on binding dynamics.  These first two aims will be done using the model system of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is easy to work with but is quite similar to mammalian cells in its molecular makeup.  In the third aim, the effect of impairing function of specific subunits of Mediator in mammalian cells on gene transcription will be tested by ""knocking down"" expression of those subunits and measuring the effect on genome-wide transcription by high throughput sequencing.  In yeast, this has been a productive strategy for understanding how Mediator structure relates to its function.  Comparing the results obtained in mammalian cells will reveal similarities and differences with yeast, and thereby reveal the value and limitations of knowledge gained using the yeast system.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Using baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), experiments will focus on understanding how cells coordinate genome-wide changes in gene expression following heat stress.  Because the heat stress response is evolutionarily conserved, research using yeast as the model is expected to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms employed in more complex organisms. Additional broader impacts of this research include the training of two graduate students and summer research opportunities for three high school biology teachers from a school district with a large, underrepresented minority population.     The dynamic regulation of stress-responsive genes is critical for viability of all eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae, the gene-specific and evolutionarily conserved activator, Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1), plays a central role in stimulating both basal and induced transcription of HSP genes. These genes encode molecular chaperones that are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis and in combating proteotoxic stress. Whether Hsf1 is also responsible for the global down-regulation of non-HSP gene expression following exposure to thermal stress is unknown. Aim 1 employs chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate genome-wide occupancy of Hsf1 under both non-stressful and stressful conditions, and determine the activator's role in directing the genome-wide occupancy of Mediator, a central coactivator and signal integrator of Pol II transcription. In addition, comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis will be used to measure global transcription rates and correlate these with genome-wide Hsf1, Mediator and Pol II occupancy. Aim 2 employs chromosome conformation capture techniques to characterize the in vivo conformation and nuclear organization of Hsf1-regulated genes under both non-inducing and heat shock-inducing conditions. A key goal is to solidify evidence that HSP genes loop, 'crumple' (accordion-style) and coalesce into transcriptionally active foci following exposure of cells to heat shock, and determine the kinetics with which they form and dissipate looped DNA structures. Additionally, through use of looping, crumpling and coalescence-deficient mutants, the biological significance of these phenomena will be explored.

About 700,000 people die annually in US hospitals and 16% of them were diagnosed with sepsis (including a high prevalence of severe sepsis with major  complication). In addition to being deadly, sepsis is the most expensive condition associated with in-hospital stay, resulting in a 75% longer stay than any other condition.  The total burden of sepsis to the US healthcare system is estimated to be $20.3 billion, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, in June 2015 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that sepsis accounted for over $7 billion in Medicare payments (second only to major joint replacement), a close to 10% increase from the previous year.  This pervasive drain on health care resources is due, in part, to difficulties in diagnosis and delayed treatment. For example, every one hour delay in treatment of severe sepsis/shock with antibiotics decreases a patient's survival probability by 10%. Many of these deaths could have been averted or postponed if a better system of care was in place. The goal of this research is to overcome these barriers by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.  The  project to bring together health care providers, researchers, educators, and students to add value to patient care by integrating machine learning, decision analytical models, human factors analysis, as well as system and process modeling to advance scientific knowledge, predict sepsis, and prevent sepsis-related health deterioration. In addition to the societal impact that clinical translation of these findings may bring, the project will provide engineering and computer science students and health services researchers with cross-disciplinary educational experience.    The proposed research will apply engineering and computer science methodologies to analyze patient level EHR across two large scale health care facilities, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Christiana Care Health System and to inform clinical decision making for sepsis. The multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration will enable the development of health care solutions for sepsis by describing and accurately risk-stratifying hospitalized patients, and developing decision analytical models to personalize and inform diagnostic and treatment decisions considering patient outcomes and response implications. The Sepsis Early Prediction Support Implementation System (S.E.P.S.I.S.) project aims will be to: 1) Develop data-driven models to classify patients according to their clinical progression to diagnose sepsis and predict risk of deterioration, thus informing therapeutic actions. 2) Develop personalized intervention policies for patients within the sepsis spectrum.  3) Develop decision support systems (DSS) for personalized interventions focusing on resource implications and usability within a real hospital setting. The team will 1) identify important factors that uncover patient profiles based on Bayesian exponential family principal components analysis; 2) develop hidden Markov models (HMMs) and input-output HMMs to identify clusters of patients with similar progression patterns within the sepsis spectrum; 3) provide an analytical framework to support sepsis staging in clinical practice using bilevel optimization. They will 1) predict short- and long-term individual patient outcomes using multivariate statistical models and simulation; 2) develop semi-Markov decision process and partially observable semi-Markov decision process models to identify timing of therapeutic actions and diagnostic tests. Furthermore, the team will 1) predict demand for resources and develop and validate a hybrid mixed integer programming and queueing model to optimize system level allocations; 2) utilize human factors analysis and usability testing to assess the implementation of the DSS.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

But there is another critical factor in contrast perception that is less well understood: the object's duration. Eye movements, motion of the object in the world, and lighting that changes over time, such as flicker in artificial lighting, all act to vary the amount of time that the object shines photons onto the photoreceptors of the retina. Psychological experiments showed that the apparent contrast, the salience of the object against its background, is highest when an object is presented for ~60-~90 milliseconds and reduced if the object is presented for too short or too long a duration.  Dr. Stephen Macknik and his colleagues at the Barrow Neurological Institute will investigate the neural physiological processes underlying these temporal effects by recording electrical activity of single neurons from the visual cortex. This project will provide the empirical data leading to a mechanistic account of how these temporal effects occur. Understanding the neural mechanisms that determine optimal duration of object presentation may allow the discovery of the optimal flickering rate in the artificial lighting. It is possible that temporal dynamics in lighting that is different from what is used in today's flickering lighting can support optimal perception and at the same time save power.  That is, if visual lighting is optimized to human perception, less electrical current could be used in lighting devices to achieve the same amount of apparent contrast as in current ""unoptimized"" artificial lighting dynamics.     To investigate the neural mechanisms associated with optimal stimulus durations, the investigators will record from the ON versus OFF neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1) that increase and decrease their firing rates in response to light increments and decrements respectively. They will test the hypothesis that the interplay between these two types of neurons will explain the variations in perceived contrast associated with different stimulus durations.  To ensure that the findings are applicable to real world scenarios such as lighting in the office and home, the investigators will use not only carefully controlled visual stimuli (Objective 1) but also visual stimuli from natural scenes (Objective 2). Finally, the investigators will determine how higher level cognitive functions, specifically attention, modulates the interactions between both single ON and OFF neurons and populations of ON and OFF neurons (Objective 3). Contrast perception is fundamental to all vision, normal or diseased. Yet the large body of scientific literature has mainly focused on contrast across visual space and little is known about how contrast perception vary with stimulus duration.  The current project fills this major knowledge gap by taking the temporal aspect of contrast perception into consideration and suggesting new roles for the well studied ON and OFF neurons.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

We can select words precisely out of a large lexicon with remarkably low error rates. It is perhaps not surprising that this complex speech production system is easily affected by disease. Brain damage induced language disorders affect millions of Americans, and there is little hope of remediation. Research on the anatomical, physiological, and computational bases of speech production has made important strides in recent years but this has been limited by a glaring lack of information on the dynamics of the process. This limitation results from the low spatio-temporal resolution of the available tools to collect data and the effectiveness of the current tools for analysis. Our driving vision in this project is to develop an unparalleled understanding of cortical connectivity in the human language system at small spatio-temporal scales. We possess much expertise in signal decoding of the processes of cued word production with intracranial recording techniques, as well as using cortical stimulation to modulate the system. FDA-approved arrays will be used to perform closed-loop decoding of sensorimotor processes during speech production and transient neuromodulation of the language system in patients with epilepsy undergoing intracranial electrode placement for the localization of seizures. Ultimately though, the fine-grained understanding and representation of sensorimotor loops in the language system necessitates the development of ultra-small energy efficient detectors that will enable the knowledge gained in this exploratory project to be eventually applied in patients who have sustained neurological injuries that have resulted in pervasive language impairments. This integrative project brings innovative microelectronics technologies together with state of the art large data analysis techniques to begin to develop a first of its kind system to remediate language disorders.    The engineering objective is to develop biocompatible microchips to vastly enhance our insight into language and other cognitive processes and learning.

Plants, including crops, respond to cues from the environment in many ways.  Among these responses are changes in the ways that genes are expressed.  Understanding and manipulating these changes are likely to be profitable means for improving crop productivity.  The subject of this research is a protein (termed AtCPSF30) that is important for the responses of plants to environmental stresses, as well as to other cues (or developmental signals) that guide development from a seedling to a mature and productive plant.  The goals of the research are to understand how this protein helps the plant to discriminate between different cues, so that subsequent changes in gene expression are appropriate to the respective stress or developmental signal.  This research will lead to a better understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses, and to how stresses affect different aspects of growth and development.  This understanding will allow scientists to develop improved crop varieties, and will help producers to make informed decisions regarding crop and variety choice, as well as production management.      Technical description of the project:    The subject of this study is a hypothetical hub that transduces cellular signaling cues into differential poly(A) site choices and phenotypic outcomes. This hub, the 30 kD subunit of the so-called Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor in Arabidopsis (AtCPSF30), is regulated in vitro by two distinctive chemical or biochemical signals (calcium and redox signals), and is involved in a range of developmental and physiological responses. The goals of the research are to determine how these different signaling cues are transduced to specific outcomes, potentially through alternative polyadenylation (APA) during pre-mRNA processing. The goals will be accomplished by testing these three hypotheses:    1. Different signaling inputs are processed, through AtCPSF30, into differing sets of APA events and outcomes.  2. AtCPSF30-mediated APA alters mRNA functionality for some of the numerous direct targets of the protein.  3. AtCPSF30-mediated APA affects gene expression early in lateral root development.    Extensive use will be made of systems approaches - both high-throughput DNA sequencing and computational analyses of large datasets.

One group of molecules that are important for nerve cell migration (called Ephrins) exist as multiple types in mammals, making their detailed functions difficult to study. Taking advantage of the fact that insects (including the tobacco hornworm Manduca used here) produce a single type of Ephrin protein, a molecule (RACK1) that Ephrin interacts with in a major way during nerve cell development has been identified. This project will determine how RACK1 works together with Ephrin to regulate nerve cell migration and circuit development. The new discoveries made during this project will provide valuable information about how Ephrins function during nervous system development in more complex animals, including the human brain. The project will also provide unique opportunities for undergraduate students to learn advanced methods for investigating how specific proteins regulate nerve cell growth. Students will conduct experiments in Manduca to test the role of Ephrin and RACK1 in this process, and to identify other proteins that are required for Ephrin function.

In addition, discoveries from this project will be presented to more general audiences at the Oregon Health and Science University Brain Fair, an interactive educational opportunity that is held annually at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.    This project will investigate how type-A Ephrins (which are attached to cells by GPI lipid anchors) can regulate the activity of intracellular tyrosine kinases in the Src family, and how this signaling pathway controls the migratory behavior of developing neurons. Preliminary studies indicate that the adapter protein RACK1 (Receptor of Activated Protein Kinase C) functions as a molecular rheostat that restricts Src signaling until MsEphrin signaling is initiated. Studies will be carried out using a well-characterized assay of neuronal migration in cultured Manduca embryos. Targeted manipulations of gene expression will test whether RACK1 is essential for the activation of a specific Src kinase (Src42) by type-A Ephrins. Biochemical assays of Src activity and Src-RACK1 interactions will test whether RACK1 functions as both a regulator and substrate for Src42 in this process. Time-lapse imaging and quantitative assays of neuronal migration will be used to investigate how this signaling pathway affects specific aspects of neuronal behavior in the developing nervous system.

This project investigates whether the early embryo uses extracellular microvesicles (exosomes), as tissue-specifying signaling agents. Exosomes are a recently discovered class of small, membrane-bound particles secreted from cells. It is now known that exosomes carry proteins involved with cell-cell recognition and signaling on their surfaces, and also that they contain microRNAs and mRNAs with the potential to alter gene expression patterns of cells receiving them. The ability of exosomes secreted from one cell type to ""reprogram"" other cells at a distance has been demonstrated in tissue culture, but whether this exciting property is utilized during normal embryonic development is not known. The current project investigates this possibility by pursuing the observation that blood formation requires exosomes. The goals of this research are to investigate the cell biology of exosomal exchange in during embryogenesis in frogs.  The project will address whether qualitative or quantitative changes in the exosomal proteins occur during early development? Which tissues secrete exosomes? Are specific tissues in the early frog embryo targeted by exosomes; if so, how do those tissues respond? Can altering the secretion or specificity of exosome uptake alter embryonic blood development? Answering these questions will advance the nascent, rapidly growing field of exosomal cell biology, and expand our understanding of the repertoire of signaling mechanisms used by embryonic cells early in normal development. Many aspects of this research present excellent hands-on opportunities for students and trainees at all levels, and thus can serve as a critical starting point or advancement step for developing careers in biology or biomedicine.    This project explores the novel hypothesis that the early Xenopus embryo uses extracellular microvesicles, specifically exosomes, for embryonic tissue patterning. Exosomes have recently been recognized as potent conveyors of membrane-associated signaling ligands and receptors, functional microRNAs and mRNAs, but most such demonstrations have been in limited tissue-culture situations. Recent work demonstrated that an extracellular compartment in the intact early Xenopus embryo is highly enriched with exosomes. Mass spectroscopic proteomic analysis confirms an abundance of exosomal markers, and electron microscopy confirms an abundance of particles in the size range typical of exosomes. Embryos reared deprived of microvesicles develop with a characteristic set of morphological defects, particularly a profound reduction in hematopoiesis, suggesting a fundamental role for exosome-dependent signaling during tissue specification steps of early development. This significant cell-biological activity has not previously been explored in a vertebrate embryo, so the goals of this project are to characterize exosomes, including the time course of their appearance, their cargo and the surface proteins that potentially define their tissue target specificity. This information will be used to develop probes and reagents to investigate their tissue origins and potential tissue targets.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This proposal focuses on a newly-discovered process called Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB) that allows cells to make targeted changes to the structure of their connections with other cells. Three sets of experiments will be carried out, examining (1) molecular changes that underlie NEB, (2) the mechanical means through which NEB is accomplished, and (3) how NEB actually functions in newly-developing cell-to-cell connections.  An exciting and novel aspect of this latter set of experiments is the use of live cell microscopy to document the development of new connections in real time as they form in a living organism.  These studies will provide novel and critical insights into how the brain develops and into how our experiences can lead to changes in our neuronal circuitry.    This proposal takes advantage of the well-established Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model of synapse outgrowth and maturation to further our understanding of how RNA granules are formed and subsequently trafficked to synaptic sites during development.  In particular, these studies will focus on the recently described process of Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB), a nuclear export pathway by which RNA granules that contain postsynaptic transcripts are released from postsynaptic muscle nuclei. In Aim 1, we will investigate how Pin1, a highly conserved enzyme, functions to regulate NEB via nuclear lamina remodeling.  In Aim 2, we will explore the role of a non-canonical Nuclear Pore Complex that we hypothesize loads mRNA transcripts into RNA granules forming at the periphery of the nucleus.  Finally, in Aim 3, we will take advantage of a new tool to image trafficking dynamics of RNA granules in postsynaptic muscles at the time of synaptogenesis.  This proposal utilizes high resolution imaging modalities including array tomography, immunogold EM and live cell imaging. These approaches, combined with the genetic tractability of the in vivo system, poise this study to make a significant contribution to our understanding of RNA granule biology and provide exciting new mechanistic insight into the bidirectional communication that occurs between the nucleus and the forming synapse during NMJ development.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

In the past, all Mn dissolved in seawater was thought to exist in only one chemical form: Mn(II).  Recent work in waters and sediments with little or no oxygen has shown that Mn(III) can be the dominant form of dissolved Mn and can even be present in oxygenated water if attached to specific organic molecules called ligands. This research will further investigate these discoveries, aiming to quantify the chemical and microbiological processes responsible for Mn(III) cycling under varying oxygen concentrations. The research will compare field sites in the Broadkill River wetland, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary; measuring the water column and sediments known to have strong oxygen gradients and different organic carbon sources that could change the availability and binding strength of ligands that would stabilize dissolved Mn(III). In some chemical forms, Mn tends to act like iron, so this research may have broader implications by helping marine chemists to understand more about iron cycling in similar oxygen gradients. With growing concerns over diminished oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) in the ocean, and particularly in coastal regions, understanding the reactions of Mn(III) with organic ligands across oxygen gradients could become important for understanding Mn availability to organisms. The project includes support for the participation and mentoring of one graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers, and there will be a U.S.-Canada collaboration. A variety of public outreach activities are planned with a K-12 teacher to be selected as a participant on a research cruise.    Mn(III) has only recently been recognized as an important redox state for Mn in seawater. Previously, it was widely accepted that all Mn that passes through a 0.2 or 0.4 µm filter is dissolved Mn(II) while the retained portion is solid Mn(III, IV) oxide.  Research in the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay has shown that soluble Mn(III) can be up to 100% of the dissolved Mn in the water column.  Also, Mn(III) can exist as complexes with organic ligands in oxygenated seawater. This project will quantify and constrain the mechanisms surrounding weak and strong Mn(III) ligand transformations across vertical and horizontal oxygen gradients.  Field sites to be studied include systems with a variety of organic carbon sources and oxygen dynamics: the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, and Broadkill River wetland estuary. This research will continue to inform the fundamental shift that is taking place in our current understanding of Mn biogeochemistry in coastal systems.  The results should also be applicable to redox processes involving Fe(III) ligand transformations, since Mn and Fe tend to exhibit similar redox chemistry under similar environmental conditions.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Jones (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) and Dr. Arthur D. Murphy (University of North Carolina, Greensboro), investigates the effects of community networks on individual and family responses to mass trauma and extreme events. Mass trauma events, such as public venue shootings and bombings, linger in people's lives long after the events themselves. They also tie together former strangers and do so in ways that significantly affect the recovery process for both individuals and communities. The goal of the research is to understand how different networked groups develop, how they change over time, and how those changes affect and are affected by their reaction to the events and their aftermath. Because this is a dynamic process that begins right after an event takes place and unfolds over years, Jones and Murphy have taken a  longitudinal approach: a sustained, focused, long-term investigation of how social groups emerge, coalesce, and divide, as well as how they affect and are affected by their contexts and memberships, during the recovery process.  Their focal event is a 2009 fire that broke out in a Hermasillo, Mexico, day care center and killed 49 young children while also injuring many more. This award supports a third round of data collection and analysis.    The researchers will map out the formal named groups of local residents and affected families and the informal sub-networks (calculated with hierarchical clustering) among parents and caretakers. They also will conduct in-depth interviews and participant observation (such as attending marches, meetings, commemorations) to understand how the different subgroups generate diverse meanings and pathways to recovery over time. The network data will be analyzed with formal network modeling measures of embeddedness and bridging. The interview data will be coded for analysis with text analysis software. Preliminary findings suggest that while participation in a network of people who shared and understood their experience sometimes afforded a support advantage, this was not always true. Jones and Murphy will explore the sources of disagreement and conflict, how these affect recovery, and what produces exceptions where these conflicts and individual problems like guilt, depression, fear and helplessness are overcome. This project builds new links between the fields of community psychology and anthropology in disaster and trauma studies. It also brings insights on impact and recovery to a broader audience of political scientists interested in extreme events and governance, geographers who study hazards and vulnerability, and sociologists  concentrating on disasters and social organization.

While mammary developmental biologists have gathered a wealth of molecular and cellular data, fundamental questions remain. For example, it is still unknown how cells of various types become organized into a duct. How is the organization affected by system perturbations such as altered signaling processes? The answers to these questions rely on an understanding of signaling and behavioral ""rules"" governing normal ductal morphogenesis and maintenance. Experimental investigations of these interactions, complemented by mathematical models, can help facilitate the understanding and definition of these rules. In this project, the investigators employ a joint experimental and mathematical modeling approach to study mammary gland development with a focus on ductal morphogenesis. With respect to cellular and tissue level parameters, the investigators design specific experiments to measure model parameters and validate model results. Particular emphasis will be placed on the nature of the signaling vs. receiving cell type(s). In parallel, the complementary expertise will be leveraged and used to develop a multiscale mathematical and computational framework to bridge the gap between tissue scale models of ductal morphogenesis and cellular scale models with detailed cell arrangements. This integrative project will allow for predicting what occurs in response to system perturbations such as loss-of-function due to mutations or epigenetic events. This can provide insight on the emergence of abnormal development programs and the initiation of tumors. The methods developed here will be applicable to modeling other organs with branching architectures such as lung, salivary, olfactory epithelium and prostate glands. Beyond these applications, the new tools developed here will also impact other problems in the biological sciences including development of other tissues and organs, wound healing, and tissue regeneration that are characterized by processes occurring in concert over a wide range of space and time scales.       One of the fundamental questions in biology is how tissues and organs develop and become organized. Developmental processes are the result of complex mechanical and signaling processes occurring inside and outside cells, and between cells and the environment. Such complex processes are very difficult to understand by using conventional experiment-based approaches alone. Recently, it has been recognized that mathematical modeling can provide a unique and complementary tool to experimental investigations by generating experimentally testable hypotheses, and that an integrated experimental and computational approach can potentially be more powerful than solely using experimental investigation, in identifying mechanisms responsible for non-intuitive developmental behavior frequently observed in experiments. However, the developmental processes involve interactions across a wide range of spatial and temporal biological scales. Thus, new mathematical models describing biological behavior at different scales, and at different levels of complexity, should be developed, linked together, and experimentally validated to provide a theoretical predictive framework to complement current developmental biology research. This is precisely what this project will address in the context of the mammary gland, for which it is still unknown how the cells of various types become organized and how this organization is affected by perturbations to the system such as from mutations. Specifically, these questions will be addressed by drawing on the complementary expertise of the researchers in mathematical and computational modeling and in experimental techniques to create and analyze a multiscale modeling framework for mammary gland development. The parameters in the models will be measured, and the models will be validated, using specifically designed experiments.

Many children with CP have some form of upper extremity limitations. Reduced function of the hands hinder dressing, personal hygiene, and use of assistive devices, resulting in greater dependency, restricted social participation, and a decreased quality of life. Recent investigations have indicated that the brain is capable of reorganizing itself through targeted use. Functional recovery requires repeated practice, however traditional therapy sessions are inadequate in duration and intensity. Soft robotic devices show promise as a therapy extender needed for motor learning. No device has shown comprehensive capabilities to address this need in children, particularly a device that can provide continuous measurements and data monitoring, characterize the spastic resistance, and accommodate growth as needed. The soft-­&#8208;robotic glove, REHAB Glove, developed in this project will fill an important gap to improve independence and to reduce burden of care. The capabilities of this glove will not only address the therapy need of CP children but will also act as an important tool for data gathering for the development of dosage based therapy regimes for better outcomes. The proposed research will also serve as a training ground for medical and engineering students to become competent researchers as they will have the opportunity to join the project team for internships, mentorships, job shadowing, enrichment programs or summer academy.    Current hand rehabilitation devices, based on end-­&#8208;effector and hard exoskeleton structures, are complex, have limited degrees of freedom, and are mostly applicable to only four fingers of the hand. All of these factors limit their capacity to support complex hand rehabilitation. Furthermore, the widespread usage of these systems in home environments is hindered by their mechanical complexity, cost, and potential safety concerns. Recent advances in soft robotics using flexible structures and actuators are being explored to reduce the complexity of these devices and improve human-­&#8208;robotic interaction. In this work, a sensorized soft robotic glove will be developed using novel soft-­&#8208;and-­&#8208;rigid hybrid actuators alongside an advanced control unit with closed-­&#8208;loop control. The PIs postulate that using a sensorized therapeutic glove capable of monitoring and assisting patient hand motion will enable children with CP to complete repetitive motions, and that children and parents can accept the robotic glove as a tool to optimize their rehabilitation. This device will help reduce the complexity, size, and cost associated with current state-­of-­the-­art care as well as enable the development of dosage based therapy studies. The soft robotic glove is made of compliant elastomeric material, which provides a safe user-­device interaction and allows customized fitting onto hands with different conditions and sizes. Sensor integration will provide the capability to monitor and record hand motion and thus evaluate the rehabilitation progress and facilitate clinical research of the hand. With an associated control unit, the device can be portable and used at home or in the hospital. This project leverages a unique collaboration that brings cutting-­edge engineering, therapy, and clinical knowledge to the development of an efficacious assistive technology that can be used to facilitate recovery of hand function.

However, due to the highly repetitive nature of DNA present in centromeres, further studies in identifying the make-up of this portion of DNA have been limited. In response to the roadblocks caused by the limited amount of research in this area, this project aims to advance our knowledge of centromere biology and evolution. This research will support outreach activities focused on the biology of gibbons, a critically endangered group of primates that has a unique centromere structure that could inform future studies. As the main threats for these species are from human activities, a large part of the outreach effort for this work seeks to increase awareness of the precarious state of this species. Current conservation efforts, encompassing different venues, include informal seminars to the public and collaborations with primate centers and museums. In addition, this project will promote education through training of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate and local high school programs by providing experiential learning and exposure to modern technologies and training workshops.     While expansions of DNA within centromeres are known for many species, most centromeres are stable over evolutionary time and relatively uniform across all centromeres in one genome. Decoupling equilibration events across chromosomes from the initial seeding events specific to a subset of chromosomes has not been possible in most model systems. This project capitalizes on the recently discovered centromeric expansion of a selfish element, the LAVA retroelement, in a subset of chromosomes in one gibbon genus (Hoolock). This project will build upon foundational discoveries in gibbon centromeres, the newly released gibbon genome sequence and novel genomics approaches for studying complex, repeat-rich regions. This project will test the hypothesis that both LAVA and neighboring satellite DNA bind inner kinetochore proteins, implicating genetic conflict in the seeding and expansion at centromeres. Second, based on observations that the Hoolock centromere structure is similar to that found in marsupials and plants, this project will include analyses of transcripts from centromeric repeats to determine whether transcription from centromere retroelements is associated with young centromere restructuring or with subsequent stabilization.

Mycobacteria are a branch of the bacterial kingdom that includes both pathogens and brownfield soil-dwelling species. A novel kind of highly effective DNA transfer process, in which two cells appear to swap DNA fragments along the whole chromosome, has been described for a common laboratory mycobacterial species.

DCT will also be tested in other isolates of M. smegmatis, and in other mycobacterial species. Genome sequencing of new isolates will provide comparative data for identifying the mosaicism that is a hallmark of DCT, and provide reference sequences for transconjugants generated in the laboratory.

DNA lesions can block replication, triggering a cascade of events leading to cell death. To prevent this, cells utilize translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases that can copy over the DNA lesions while temporarily leaving them unrepaired. These TLS enzymes are central to cell survival after DNA damage; however, they are also error-prone and often introduce mutations in genomic DNA. The project will employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines structural biology, biochemical methods and in vivo assays to decipher key protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlying mutagenic TLS in a yeast model system. This research will advance our understanding of the structural organization of the multi-protein TLS complexes and also provide new insights into mechanistic questions about TLS: How do mutagenic TLS enzymes gain access to DNA replication forks? How do active multi-polymerase complexes assemble? What molecular events drive TLS DNA polymerase switching? These questions are central to our understanding of events leading to mutagenesis in eukaryotes and the ability of cells to cope with DNA damage and faithfully transfer genetic information from one generation to the next. This project creates a solid platform for integration of research and education at multiple levels, from advanced post-PhD training to K-12 education. The project will provide plentiful material for graduate and undergraduate teaching, including advanced training courses such as the Connecticut NMR Workshop, laboratory projects for graduate students, and mini-projects for the diverse undergraduate students from the Undergraduate Summer Research Internship program. Finally, it will also engage students from the nearby Farmington High School in ""real world"" scientific research under the umbrella of the Cutting Edge Bioresearch Internship program.     In S. cerevisiae, replicative bypass of most DNA lesions requires the coordinated action of TLS polymerases Rev1, pol eta and pol zeta that replace replicative polymerases at replication forks stalled by DNA damage or fill damage-containing single-stranded DNA gaps left after replication. This process is initiated by mono-ubiquitination of the processivity factor PCNA, which plays a key role in the assembly of the multi-polymerase TLS complex at DNA damage sites. The mechanism by which this TLS complex, often called the Rev1/pol zeta mutasome, is assembled on ubiquitinated PCNA is poorly understood. Important questions remain unanswered about how TLS enzymes gain access to sites of DNA damage and how DNA polymerases switch during TLS. The main goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which the TLS mutasome achieves efficient lesion bypass by analyzing its organization at a structural level. Our central hypothesis is that mutasome activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediated by accessory domains and regulatory subunits of the TLS DNA polymerases. We will test this hypothesis by using a structural analysis to precisely map PPIs that influence the assembly of the S. cerevisiae Rev1/pol zeta mutasome, combined with in vivo assays to probe the significance of these PPIs for mutagenic TLS. To date, the structure and PPIs of accessory modules of yeast TLS enzymes remain largely uncharacterized. To gain insights into the structural organization and regulation of the yeast TLS machinery, we will undertake the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine key PPIs that control the Rev1/pol zeta mutasome interactions with the sliding clamp PCNA. In Aim 2, we will determine structures and probe PPIs of the essential accessory modules that mediate assembly of the Rev1/pol zeta complex. In Aim 3, we will explore additional PPIs that stabilize multi-subunit Rev1/pol zeta assembly. The project will provide new insights into how individual components of the TLS mutasome work together to achieve efficient lesion bypass.

The mechanisms of USP7 activation will be addressed by determining the arrangement of individual USP7 domains within the full-length enzyme. The molecular basis of USP7 specificity towards its substrates will be addressed by identifying and mapping distinct sites on C-USP7 responsible for recognition of two transcription factors, p53 and FOX(O)4.  An array biophysical and spectroscopic methods will be employed in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Unlike most organisms that use the RNA copied from DNA ""as is"" for directing protein synthesis, in the energy-generating mitochondria of trypanosomes (and other organisms), the RNA is edited by addition or removal of specific information. Why editing occurs is not clear, but understanding how it happens may provide important clues about the function of this type of genetic alteration. The project will have broad educational impact by providing interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  In addition, specific efforts will target students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.      This project focuses on the process of RNA editing in the mitochondria of trypanosomes. Through the action of a central editing enzyme, called RECC, uridylates are inserted or deleted at thousands of specific sites in dozens of mRNAs. This extensive editing process is directed by hundreds of small non-coding guide RNAs and involves several auxiliary factors. However, the mechanistic basis of the regulation of editing remains a long-standing question in trypanosomal RNA biology. In previous work, a regulatory editing subcomplex, called REH2C, was identified and found to contain three protein subunits.  Two of these, a helicase and a zinc-finger protein, appear to participate directly in editing. A combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatics, and proteomic approaches will be used to address how these proteins assemble with mRNAs and guide mRNAs into editosome complexes in vivo and how the complexes carry out editing functions. These studies may establish new paradigms in RNA editing regulation. In a broader sense, the studies will allow a better understanding of how this amazing process evolved. This system can be used to draw analogies with related RNA helicases and RNA processes that are directed by small guide RNAs and that evolved more recently in eukaryotic lineages.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Early diagnosis is critically important for successful treatment, and can prevent most cases of blindness. However, lack of access to expert medical diagnosis and care, especially in rural areas, remains a growing healthcare challenge. In addition, clinical expertise in ROP is lacking, and medical professionals are struggling to meet the increasing need for ROP care. As point-of-care technologies for diagnosis and intervention are rapidly expanding, the potential ability to assess ROP severity from any location with an internet connection and a camera, even without immediate ophthalmologic consultation available, could significantly improve delivery of ROP care by identifying infants who are in most urgent need for referral and treatment. This would dramatically reduce the incidence of blindness without a proportionate increase in the need for human resources, which take many years to develop.     This project develops a prototype assistive integrative support tool for ROP, featuring a modular design comprising: (a) image analysis, (b) information fusion of clinical, imaging, and diagnostic data, and (c) generative probabilistic and regression models with associated computationally efficient machine learning algorithms. The outcomes of the project include disease severity metrics and diagnostic estimates obtained through clinical evidence classifiers trained jointly over expert-generated labels. These labels consist of discrete diagnostic labels, as well as comparison outcomes of relative severity between pairs of images. Random process models for vessel tortuosity and diameter distributions over the retina, as well as patch-based vessel-free image analysis through the use of convolutional neural networks on the entire image, enhance and augment feature extraction. Moreover, incorporating severity comparison outcomes through novel hard and soft constraint methods force inferred severity to agree with ordinal information provided by experts and address inherent uncertainty in expert ground-truth labels. The above severity inference methods are evaluated and fine-tuned over a broad array of generative models, both through retrospective analysis, including cross-validation, longitudinal tests, and tests across multiple sites, as well as through prospective analysis, evaluating its real-world clinical impact.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Despite decades of effort, commercial production of microalgae-derived biofuels has not emerged because current technologies for microalgae dewatering add a huge cost to the final product, and present a major barrier between algaculture and biofuels.     A knowledge gap exists in the underlying principles governing microalgae dewatering, particularly for the rational design of coagulation agents. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to understand the underlying principles that govern the stability of a colloidal suspension of living cells, and to direct the phase separation of free-floating cells in a controllable fashion. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the rational correlations between inter-algal pair interactions and coagulation-agent structures in order to achieve highly efficient microalgae dewatering at a negligible cost. The central hypothesis is that nanoparticle-pinched polymer brushes, i.e., radiating polymer chains covalently bonded to a nanoparticulate core, are far more effective in dewatering microalgae than conventional flocculants; in addition, using solid-state nanoparticles allows low-cost operations (e.g., using magnetic fields) to be designed to collect algal biomass and retrieve the coagulation agents for multiple cycles of microalgae dewatering, which further reduces the operational cost significantly. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our strongly supportive preliminary data. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that, once the structural characteristics responsible for the unusually high performance of this novel coagulation agent are understood, precise control of its structure is expected to enable unprecedentedly cost-effective microalgae dewatering. Hence the bottleneck preventing commercialization of microalgae-derived biofuels will be cleared. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1. Identify a facile and highly efficient approach to synthesize paramagnetic nanoparticle-pinched polymer brushes with well-defined structures; 2. Determine how the microalgae dewatering efficiency is regulated by the structural characteristics of the coagulation agents; 3. Determine the efficiency of retrieving nanoparticle-pinched polymer brushes for continuous cycles of microalgae growth and dewatering. The expected contribution of this work is to determine the structural characteristics of engineered coagulation agents that endow them with an unusually high efficiency in microalgae dewatering and an unusually low operational cost. This contribution is significant, because it creates a class of super coagulation agents via examining rational correlations between inter-algal pair interactions and flocculants of well-defined structures. This aspect has been poorly understood despite decades of relentless trial-and-error experiments with commercially available chemicals.     Energy and environment represent the top challenges for the sustainable development of our societies. It is well understood that securing renewable energy sources is the grand challenge of our time, but it is not always recognized that any engineered material proposed to address that challenge must be sustainable itself, an example is the design of microalgae coagulation agent in this application. The researchers plan to bring broad societal awareness on this aspect with the following integrated activities: Incorporating research into teaching. The assembled research team will be a nucleus to enhance biofuel research at Mines by giving seminars, developing course materials, and attracting industry sponsorship. The PI will build a webpage devoted to microalgae harvesting issues, and disseminate the video clips of microalgae dewatering experiments to Youtube to advertise sustainable materials for sustainable energy; Outreach to Underrepresented Groups. The researchers plan to build a focused and sustainable outreach program by developing lecture materials and classroom demonstration experiments on algal biofuels, which will be used by the PI and his graduate students, to participate in an existing outreach program at Mines that spans grades kindergarten through the twelfth in two school districts, Adams County District 50 (AC50) and Meeker County (MC).

MPs represent a family of biologically-derived and bio-renewable high-performance nanomaterials that are largely unexplored. These proteins are the ""gate-keepers"" of cells, and are involved in critical life processes, such as energy conversion, matter transport and information processing. These same MP-mediated functions are also highly coveted nanoengineering feats in synthetic systems. Exploiting MPs for nanoengineering may help understand, predict, and ultimately control recognition and transport at the nanoscale, but is greatly impeded by the fluidic and labile nature of biomembranes. This study bridges the gap between biotic and abiotic systems by developing chemically versatile synthetic membranes to support MP functions. The successful outcome of this study will help unleash the full potential of MPs to create novel nanotechnologies ranging from solar conversion to high throughput diagnostics. With respect to broad impact on education, this project builds a multi-tiered education program on renewable materials. The objective of this program is to bring societal awareness on sustainability, and motivate undergraduate and K-12 students to pursue career paths on bio-renewable materials. A focused outreach component, ""Summer Experience @ Mines"", targets minority students at a local high school by hosting their first exposure to engineering studies and college life, and develop curriculum materials for their Biotechnology class. A broader outreach component includes training K-12 science teachers and dissemination of the curriculum materials to local and nearby school districts.        Technical:     This award is to develop bio-hybrid materials with membrane-protein-mediated transport performance. Membrane proteins (MPs) are biologically-derived and bio-renewable high-performance nanomaterials. Despite numerous proof-of-concept demonstrations of MPs' great potential in engineered systems, little is known on how to design synthetic MP-supporting membranes that balance a dichotomy between fluidity and stability, and how to direct spontaneous MP reconstitution into these robust membranes to form 2-dimensional (2-D) or 3-D proteomembrane arrays. Using proteorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump as a model, this study will elucidate: (1) the directed assembly principles to reconstitute proteorhodopsin into hierarchically organized proteomembrane arrays; and (2) the roles of synthetic membranes in shaping proteorhodopsin function. Since proteorhodopsin has a common seven transmembrane (7 TM) architecture of G protein-coupled receptors, a large family of MPs that regulate energy conversion, matter transport and biosensing. The guiding concepts learnt from this study have the potential to benefit a broad range of MP-based nanotechnologies.

Currently, over 1500 mobile clinics operate in the US and handle over 5 million visits per year providing essential healthcare services. These programs, however, have grown organically over time and it is important to establish evidence-based approaches to encourage a systematic expansion of this essential healthcare delivery model. This proposal addresses this issue through the use of epidemiological and economic GIS data, combined with proprietary routing software, to implement a program for optimal delivery of mobile clinic healthcare services in the Houston, Texas, region. The project involves eight different providers and includes designing systematic strategies for meeting future healthcare needs of low-income communities. The aim is also to develop models and techniques that can be implemented by mobile clinic programs throughout the country.

To achieve the above goals, the team will first apply data mining and forecasting techniques to estimate present and future demand of healthcare services in selected communities. We will combine these approaches with advance GIS mapping tools and stochastic measures to identify target population clusters. We will also conduct survey and economic analysis to measure the operational cost and identify operational constraints in the present mobile clinic programs, and develop new optimization models for the deployment of the mobile clinic service. Then, we will develop new effective techniques to solve the developed optimization models to estimate the maximum capacity of the current mobile health clinic programs in the Houston region, and identify expansion strategies to meet the future service demand while minimizing cost.

However, although studies in birds have made seminal contributions to fields such as development, neurobiology, and immunology, bird research has been hindered by the limited availability of gene manipulation tools, including the ability to make transgenic birds. In other model species, such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies, it is much easier to generate transgenic animals that directly assess the role of a particular gene of interest. Some of the most successful transgenic technologies rely on gene-editing and isolating and modifying stem cells, and then transplanting them into hosts. In contrast, in birds, the advanced age of embryos at the time eggs are laid, and the lack of efficient viral vector tools has greatly limited gene manipulation efforts. To address these limitations, the investigators develop and improve gene manipulation and stem cell technologies in birds. The project focuses on the zebra finch, a vocal learning songbird that is the most commonly used animal model to study the neural and genetic basis of human speech and language. Since other animal models commonly used in research do not have vocal learning, this is the first time that efficient methods for gene manipulation are being developed for a vocal learner species. Other beneficiaries include all avian research and possibly any egg-laying species, many of which are used to address questions in diverse areas of biology. The project also provides research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and outreach to communities typically underrepresented in science and technology fields.    To provide gene manipulation tools and protocols that will be useful not only to the songbird research community, but also to avian researchers in general, the investigators are: 1) generating transgenic zebra finches that express the genome-editing enzyme Cas9 under a ubiquitous promoter; 2) isolating, culturing, and utilizing primordial germ cells (PGCs) to improve the efficiency of generating transgenic zebra finches; and 3) developing efficient viral vectors for manipulating genes in zebra finch cells. Using established methods transgenic zebra finches are made by injecting VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors into freshly-laid fertilized eggs. When combined with CRISPR-designed guide RNAs, these transgenic songbirds enable gene-editing capabilities in a variety of tissues and cell types. To scale up and create many transgenic lines, PGC culture methods are being optimized and viral vectors with higher transfection rates in zebra finch cells developed, thus reducing the materials, time, and animals needed to create a new transgenic line, as well as greatly facilitating gene manipulations. The tools and optimized methods generated by this project will also impact avian research in fields other than birdsong biology. PGC culturing protocols can be applied to other avian species, viral vectors optimized for specific songbird tissues may also have higher transfection rates in analogous cell types of other avian species, and the Cas9-lentiviral construct could be used to generate other strains of Cas9-expressing transgenic birds.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The research proposed here will add to an interactive online platform providing tools and treatment for individuals seeking to change their relationship to substances. The technological innovation supported by this research will result in a graphical meter that provides users of the platform with a simple-to-interpret interface. This tool is designed to strengthen motivation, enhance capacity for self-assessment, and allow for the better allocation of care provision resources. This development will give the proposing organization a major competitive advantage as it contributes to the growing field of digitally-provided behavioral healthcare products. Employers, insurers, and consumers have communicated a clear demand for new methods of treating individuals with substance use disorders, and this technology will equip the proposing organization to meet that demand.

Ample research demonstrates that behavioral interventions can be effective ways to mitigate risk for individuals with unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs. Monitoring, assessing, and quantifying that recovery, however, remains out of reach for behavioral interventions delivered in the current standard-of-care. Instead of present-moment substance use recovery, the typical measure remains previous substance consumption. By statistically analyzing a range of available data from users of an online substance use recovery platform, this research will identify the data most correlated with successful recovery from substance use. Regression modeling and bivariate correlations will explore the relationships between different data within the platform and several validated outcome measures already integrated into the intervention. This research will use discourse analysis and natural language processing to identify and categorize user-submitted content to identify linguistic elements related to substance use recovery or risk of relapse.

There is alarming fact that people with cognitive impairment report more than three times as many hospital stays as individuals with other health conditions. These are driving development of improved cognitive health assessment solutions, that will detect subtle signs of cognitive decline early in daily life.

Children regularly encounter feedback at school and home as they learn new information or acquire new skills. Young learners must extract information from feedback, ignoring irrelevant, false, or misleading feedback, and using helpful feedback to adjust behavior and modify learning strategies. The ability to use feedback efficiently is an element of active, self-regulated learning that is critical to academic success. Understanding such learning in children requires studying how the quality of feedback processing in the brain changes with age through the early school years. By examining how individual cognitive differences affect the development of feedback processing, this project will enable development of effective evidence-based teaching approaches and computer-based learning programs that are tailored for children of different ages and with diverse cognitive profiles. The project will also lead to advances in treatments for children with developmental language disorders whose therapy relies on feedback provision. A broadly representative sample of children will participate in this research, and the study results will be shared with educators via education events held at schools serving low income and underrepresented students.    Feedback processing will be examined in eight- and ten-year-old children who will be followed over three years. In each yearly visit, children will learn new information using corrective feedback while their EEG is recorded. EEG activity will be analyzed to longitudinally investigate changes in children's ability to learn from feedback. The results will improve understanding of how feedback impacts learning, and how this impact changes with age. Working memory measures will also be collected each year and examined in relation to changes in feedback-based learning.

Approximately 1 in 6 children in the United States has a developmental delay that may require intervention. In the US, the cost of developmental delays among people <24 years old is estimated at $247 billion annually. Fortunately, increased access to early neurodevelopmental and behavioral health assessment services is cost-effective and results in improved outcomes. Two essential steps in the process of families receiving early intervention services to improve developmental functioning are (1) identification via screening/assessment; and (2) referral to appropriate intervention providers. This project aims to improve developmental, behavioral, and learning outcomes for at-risk children by improving accuracy of identifying children in need of developmental and educational services and monitoring responsiveness to intervention strategies. There exists broad market potential because of the challenges associated with the current standards of detecting developmental delays, particularly in children at medical risk for delays, such as premature birth. Approximately 1.7 million children each year in the 1-5 age range need close monitoring based on premature birth status alone. Additionally, children without identified risk factors also are monitored at least annually for development and pre-academic skills in pediatric clinics. There are more than 90,000 pediatricians in the United States that comprise the potential customer base.    This I-Corps project is derived from research highlighting the limitations of developmental monitoring, including reliance on parent report measures rather than direct screening and difficulties tracking development and response to developmental interventions over time. Current practices for identifying children with developmental delays vary drastically across clinics and providers. Screening procedures typically rely on parent reports of development, despite consistent reports that direct assessment of skills is superior to parent report in accuracy and improves parent and clinician confidence in results. The technology in this I-Corps project is designed to improve developmental screening and monitoring practices by providing clinicians with a standardized and norm-referenced interactive system to directly assess and monitor development in early childhood. Using a digital-based touch-screen interface, the technology will directly assess skills with reduced administration time by customizing item difficulty to the child using computer adapted testing technology.

Iron oxides are found in virtually all surface environments on Earth, and have also been identified on the surface of Mars. These tiny, often nano-sized (1 billionth of a meter), particles are also major components of paints, steel, and batteries. Despite their environmental and technological relevance, the electrochemical behavior of iron oxides in the environment remains poorly understood.

Biologically, the work can provide optimal and limiting ranges for many uncertain parameters, and explicitly disentangle adaptations in the wide range of species-specific stoichiometries and organelle-specific directionality (synthesis vs. pumping). The consideration of alternative and hypothetical mechanisms could also contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of ATP synthesis, prior to the advent of the rotary synthase, as well as aiding the study of other families of molecular machines.

By helping to quantitatively resolve certain apparently conflicting observations that have recently been made within a biological system previously thought to be well understood, this project will add fundamentally new understanding of basic mechanisms of cell signaling that may have implications across numerous receptor systems in cell biology. Moreover, due to the broadly important role that receptors, and the biochemical signals they generate, play in virtually every biological process, the new quantitative understanding gained will ultimately impact ongoing efforts to optimally engineer receptor-mediated signaling. This project also includes a broad and detailed set of integrated educational objectives that leverage the specific scientific objectives and activities of this project to reach students at different training stages and from diverse backgrounds. These education and outreach activities involve innovation upon existing programs at the partnering institutions as well as the creation of new outreach efforts that will target larger audiences, such as a summer academy of science for high school students and a collaboration with the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, FL to develop a live interaction program on cell signaling.     The biochemical signaling that results upon ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases is accompanied by receptor clustering and internalization, or endocytosis. While it has been understood for decades that endocytosis enables cells to degrade or recycle receptors, the question of how endocytosis ultimately impacts downstream signal propagation remains wide open. For example, even for the highly studied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) the literature contains highly cited, yet conflicting reports that conclude that EGFR endocytosis either promotes or impedes downstream signaling through the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In this project, the investigators will explore the hypothesis that the intrinsic complexity of the spatiotemporal signaling regulatory mechanisms creates parameter spaces for both answers to be true depending on the cellular context. The complexity of the receptor trafficking and signaling system cannot be fully dissected, however, without integrating quantitative experimental measurements that faithfully reflect cell biology with spatiotemporal computational models. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this project is to combine novel live-cell imaging of gene-edited cell systems with mechanistic models that capture system complexity with unprecedented detail to resolve the kinds of conflicting reports previously mentioned, as well as more recent surprising observations that certain proteins conventionally thought to remain in complex during signal transduction may become physically separated through trafficking processes. Ultimately, the proposed integration of gene-edited cell systems, quantitative live-cell imaging and biochemical measurements, and a spatiotemporal computational model will lead to an entirely new quantitative platform to answer these kinds of questions for EGFR and other receptor signaling systems.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

A great deal is known about how cells remove and replace cytoskeletal pieces.  However, a fundamental challenge for the cell is how to recycle the disassembled pieces.  A goal of this project is to understand how cells move the newly disassembled parts to new places where they need to be fast enough to change shape in response to external signals.  This work will reveal how cells are able to pull themselves apart, move the disassembled pieces to the right place, and put themselves back together every time they move.  The work is important because it will reveal basic principals of dynamic reorganization of the entire cell interior.  Understanding these principals is essential to learning how to coordinate cytoskeletal remodeling, knowledge that is critical for a variety of applications. Broader Impact activities will include outreach to a local science museum along with helping to build a quantitative biology community in the northwest.    Dynamic control of the actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to processes such as motility, division, and polarization. Although decades of research have defined the mechanisms that control the addition of monomers at the front of the cell and removal of monomers at the back, how the cell transports monomer from the back of the network, where it is removed, to the front of the network, where it is added is unknown.  This transport process is essential to cell homeostasis, and it is tacitly assumed to be diffusion because it is fast and difficult to measure.  The PIs have for the first time directly measured forward monomer transport.  From their measurements it is clear that forward monomer transport is faster than diffusion and dependent upon myosin II contraction. The objectives of this study are to identify the mechanism that makes forward transport of actin faster than diffusion and to define the role of myosin II contraction in driving and directing forward transport to remodel the cytoskeleton.  These objectives will be achieved by combining biophysical assays, molecular biology, photonics, single molecule imaging, and mathematical/mass transport analysis.  This project is expected to identify long-distance transport mechanisms where diffusion is too slow and direct motor coupling is unlikely because of rapid spatial and temporal changes of the intended transport destination.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The molecular nature of enhancers is not well understood, although current evidence suggests they differ from other DNA elements by having a distinct structure within the chromosomes. Structural differences can arise from enzymatic modification of the histone proteins responsible for packaging the DNA in the nucleus.  This project focuses on studying the enzymes that modify enhancer elements and how their action helps turn on critical genes at the right time and location during development. The work will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach that combines genetic, biochemical and high-throughput bioinformatics tools in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as the model organism.  Because the mechanisms governing how, when and where genes are turned on and off during development are conserved across evolution, the results should have far-reaching impact, from yeast to humans.  The project will have broad educational impact by providing students with training in multiple areas, including protein structure modeling, biochemistry, bioinformatics, genetics and advanced microscopy imaging.  Students also learn how to develop scientific hypotheses, independently carry out experiments and interpret results, prepare oral and written summaries and publish their work, skills that provide a strong technical knowledge base for diverse scientific careers.    The metazoan COMPASS related coactivator complexes catalyze the methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 4 (H3K4), epigenetic marks associated with controlling eukaryotic gene transcription. The Cmi/Trr COMPASS-like complex in Drosophila is responsible for monomethylating H3K4 and regulates enhancer activity in cooperation with transcription factors important for normal development. Trr provides histone methyltransferase activity, while Cmi contains plant homeodomain Zn fingers in two conserved clusters that co-evolved over 1.5 billion years with chromosome compaction in nucleosomes. Despite the conservation and importance in transcription control, it is not well understood how the COMPASS-like complexes are able to prime and maintain enhancer activities during development. This project focuses on the role of the conserved PHD finger domains in chromatin recognition and key cellular signaling pathways that depend on precise enhancer control. Taking advantage of the versatile Drosophila genetic model system, this project tests broad hypotheses (1) that the clustered PHD domains found in Cmi and homologous vertebrate proteins contribute essential epigenetic histone reader functions that drive the proper priming and regulation of gene enhancers and (2) the Drosophila COMPASS-like coactivator complex regulates the timing of enhancer utilization to integrate key developmental signals. One aim of this project explores the combined functions of the finger domains in the conserved PHD cluster that are essential for proper enhancer regulation. Structural modeling studies of the PHD finger domains and targeted mutagenesis, combined with in vitro and in vivo measurements of chromatin association, will define the histone recognition and binding properties of Cmi and mammalian PHD finger domains and further elucidate the mechanisms of enhancer control by the COMPASS-like complexes. A second aim incorporating developmental, genetic and molecular analyses (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, chromatin capture) will expand our understanding of target gene regulation in vivo, help correlate specific enhancer epigenetic marks with COMPASS-like complex functions, and provide significant new insights regarding conserved mechanisms of chromatin regulation.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches.     The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression.

This non-invasive device, a breathalyzer, will measure the level of ammonia in exhaled breath.  High ammonia levels are associated with conditions such as advanced liver disease, urea cycle disorders (UCD), or adverse reactions to medication.  It has serious consequences: disorientation, organ/brain damage, coma and even death, making it important to take steps to quickly reduce systemic ammonia and, if the cause is unknown, trigger further diagnostic activities.  Currently, ammonia levels are determined through blood testing, which is invasive, takes time, requires a lab/hospital visit, and is prone to errors.  There are no tools available to accurately measure ammonia, real time.  The device will enable patients and families to take control and make better decisions: what to eat, when not to drive, when to go to the hospital, among other things.  This can improve productivity, enhance quality of life for patients and their families, avoid unnecessary healthcare expenditures, and save lives.       The proposed project seeks to develop a breathalyzer prototype to detect ammonia in exhaled breath.  The device is expected to provide clinically-accurate, real time information to patients and clinicians.  Ammonia occurs naturally as a by-product of protein metabolism but, at elevated levels, it is indicative of disease and can have very serious consequences.  Contemporary research has identified roughly 250 common volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath, many associated with specific diseases. Small concentration differences can detect whether someone is healthy or ill.  This requires highly sensitive, selective and durable sensors that can perform in high humidity.  The core platform is a Reactive Spray Deposition technology, a proprietary sensor manufacturing technology that creates a porous nanostructure metal oxides grains layer, and is able to provide results with a fast response time at a low cost. This results from the ability to easily and inexpensively produce different morphologies of materials from the vapor phase in the open atmosphere in a one-step process.

In the United States over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2 minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system.

One of the most defining characteristics for the human species and the other primates is large brain size relative to body size. Yet, despite having larger brains than most other mammals, human and nonhuman primates do not show an increase in their basal metabolic rate (a measure of energy utilization by the body) compared to other mammals, raising the question of how the high energetic cost of such large brains is met. This trend suggests that there is an energetic trade-off with another energy-demanding tissue in the body when brain size increases; if we are not using more energy overall, then energy that could be invested in another part of our body is instead likely being utilized to fuel our large brains. Preliminary research shows that primates have low muscle mass when compared to other animals, and humans, who have the most notable increase in brain size, show a 50% reduction in overall muscle mass when compared with other mammals. This research therefore tests the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is in direct competition with the brain for glucose and oxygen, such that the high energetic demands of large brain size are met through constraining muscle mass, constituting an energetic tradeoff between skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, and brain growth and maintenance.          If the brain does constrain muscle mass, then 1)larger brains should be associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass; 2)the percentage of type I muscle fibers (a type of muscle cell that uses energy [glucose, a type of sugar] in a similar fashion to brain cells) should show a relative decrease in relation to larger brain size; and 3)muscle mass development should be suppressed until brain growth is complete, and once complete, there should be an increase in muscle mass development. To test these predictions, muscle tissue samples will be collected from a diverse array of primate specimens, comprising a range of brain sizes and representing all developmental stages. The generated muscle energy use profiles for each species will then be analyzed in relation to variation in brain size, with the results applied to understanding the interaction between brain size and evolved metabolic strategies.     Reducing muscle mass may have predisposed primates such as humans to certain metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes); thus, understanding if there is such a constraint has important health implications. Ultimately, the data collected can be incorporated into studies of growth and development, as well as biomechanics, and the results may encourage development of biomedical gene therapies. The research also will provide a rich database for scientists in other disciplines focusing on animal anatomy and physiology, facilitating and expanding future research.

One major obstacle has been that electrical stimulation of the brain typically affects neuronal populations that are mutually suppressive, which subverts proper neuronal signaling. The visual system has two antagonistic information channels that encode either the perception of lightness, in ON cells, or darkness, in OFF cells. Inappropriate coactivation of these two channels results in nullification of contrast, and deprived visual perception. It follows that high-quality prosthetic stimulation systems must avoid unwanted coactivation of mutually suppressive neurons, just as the natural visual system does. This is a challenge because the antagonistic neurons typically lie within microns of each other in the brain. The project aims at transformative advances in viral transfection and imaging methodology, computational theory, and cortical prosthetic neuroengineering design for the purpose of restoring vision by genetically modifying neurons in the brain and then stimulating them with light, a method called optogenetics. The expected results and methodology will form the scientific basis to build a breakthrough neuroprosthetic, with transformative potential to further brain research in sensory, motor, and cognitive parts of the cortex and to advance human medicine. To promote the development and availability of derived products to the public, the team will disseminate the discoveries to general audiences through public lectures and publications in popular science magazines. The investigators will supervise trainees from underrepresented groups, including postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. The investigators are faculty mentors for The Children's Aid Society (CAS) Workforce Development Department Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), which provides summer research opportunities to disadvantaged and minority youth in NYC to inspire them to pursue STEM careers.     Recent research has shown that, for any given retinal position, the ON and OFF cell inputs to the brain's visual cortex are purely excitatory, concentrate in a specific layer, and are laid out in a pattern that can be targeted with light from outside the brain. First, the team will modify these neurons genetically, to turn them into a novel type of photoreceptor, embedded within the brain. The team will then target light stimulation to the identified ON and OFF cells, determining the precise balance of activation to either channel to generate high-quality prosthetic vision based on a video camera's signal. This technology can then be used to bypass the eye to stimulate the brain from the camera. The project aims to develop the computational model to drive an optogenetic brain stimulation system that will optimally activate neural responses in the primary visual cortex. By comparing the neuronal responses of sighted nonhuman primates viewing natural visual stimuli to prosthetic responses in the same neurons, the work will optimize stimulation patterns that evoke naturalistic visual perception. The balanced targeting of appropriate ON and OFF inputs at each position in visual space is expected to achieve maximal contrast perception at the highest attainable acuity, with full stereoscopic binocular vision. The team's computational model of spatiotemporal visual inputs into the cortex will also account for the effects of eye movements on early visual responses, a novel approach to visual prosthetics tested here for the first time.

Efforts of many research laboratories are focused on creation of scientific codes for data generation, analysis and interpretation. However, publicly funded and often hard won scientific codes developed in a typical research laboratory too frequently become unsustainable  beyond the lifetime of funding or shortly after staff rotation. Projects that are funded to afford expensive computer science expertise simply to maintain and update existing software divert scarce resources from the lab's primary goals and often translates the problem without resolving it.  Only a select number of researchers receive sufficient funding to maintain and update software, limiting the dissemination of new ideas and techniques. The diversity and continually changing nature of software environments compounds the issues.  Enabling user utilization presents hurdles in deployment, access and training.  These issues also create barriers to the implementation of new ideas embodied in new codes.  The GenApp project's goals are to address these issues. To begin with, GenApp enables the rapid dissemination of scientific codes to researchers with minimal software expertise. As more researchers use these codes, more of them become vested in the codes, which helps their sustainability.     The fundamental goal of this project is to advance the GenApp framework into a transformative tool to broadly benefit the scientific software developer community. GenApp is a generalized application generation framework intended for rapid deployment of scientific codes, which can generate both science gateways and stand-alone applications. Among the main unique features of GenApp are the minimal technical expertise requirement for the end user and an open-end design ensuring sustainability of generated applications. To produce fully functional applications, GenApp weaves libraries of fragments and user defined modules as directed by simple definition files, created from a uniform, logical, and simple-to-encode general interface definition file provided by GenApp.  This general definition file and the underlying software can be reused indefinitely to produce applications in a variety of existing and yet-to-be defined software environments. Preserving such simplicity with GenApp's maturation is one of the main developmental strategies. To achieve the goal of GenApp four focus Aims have been proposed. The first is infrastructure development, which includes general enhancements to the capabilities of GenApp. The second is documentation, training, dissemination, outreach and sustainability - all important aspects to produce a software product that is useful to the community. The third is simply feedback, since user and developer feedback will help drive the first two Aims.  The final Aim includes two structural biology domain science applications that will adopt and drive GenApp development.  GenApp will see its primary practical utilization in making highly demanding novel computational and analysis tools accessible to experimentalists and theoreticians working in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle scattering (SAS) domains of structural biology.

It will involve patients in research, establish outreach programs, and mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from Hawaii and other underrepresented Pacific Islands in the fields of microbiology, microbial genomics and ecology, and mathematical modeling. It will contribute to the goal of reducing and perhaps eliminating difficult-to-treat NTM infections.    This study will investigate environmental and clinical nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) by comprehensively characterizing genomic signatures of these opportunistic pathogens, and identifing where they reside in the environment. Human susceptibility to NTM infections will be examined by sequencing the genomes of individuals with NTM lung disease, to investigate and identify human genetic factors influencing disease incidence, including the examination of immune genes, cilia function genes, and genes affecting body or organ morphology. Over 3,000 environmental samples from Hawaii will be examined, and whole genome sequencing of over 1,000 environmental and clinical NTM bacterial strains will be conducted to comprehensively characterize the genome evolution and population dynamics of clinically relevant NTM species on the Hawaiian islands. These data will be combined with environmental analysis of water and soil characteristics to identify variables contributing to NTM survival and colonization in the environment. Through modeling of where individuals acquire NTM infections the research will contribute to identifying specific environmental, climatological, animal reservoirs, host genetic anomalies and behaviors, and particular genetic subtypes that facilitate this acquisition, driving the high prevalence of NTM lung disease in Hawaii. The research will thereby shed light on ecological processes affecting host colonization by environmentally acquired pathogens.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Health Information Networking Tool (HINT) will be a unique combination of customized algorithms that will fill in critical gaps in knowledge, especially around health disparities, the social determinants of health and underserved conditions; boost opportunities for safety net providers to connect with peers to engage in collaborative problem-solving; reduce duplication and repetition of errors and failed interventions across safety net healthcare organizations; increase public recognition for safety net institutions that develop promising interventions; and enable technical advancements in machine learning to suggest models of care for high-need/high-cost patients. The commercial impact for HINT includes: reducing the cost and improving the quality of care delivered to high-need/high cost populations; and creating opportunities for safety net institutions and providers to market their expertise on caring for complex, underserved patients.    The proposed project was conceived on the belief that ingenious solutions in caring for society's most vulnerable populations occur daily across the safety net health system; that HINT will accelerate innovation by bringing an unprecedented resource to disseminate voluminous and constantly changing healthcare information; that the proposed information network will reduce the fragmentation of information and duplication in errors and failed interventions that currently occur; and finally that unlocking and disseminating innovations and advice from peers - in similar institutions and caring for similar patients - will accelerate successful practices to improve the health of high-need/high-cost patients. HINT proposes to develop unique crawling, clustering, text mining, collaborative filtering, bipartite matching, and ranking algorithms.

This grant develops a cloud-based platform that applies machine learning (ML) algorithms in real-time on data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and physiologic monitoring devices attached to a patient. The ML tools employed estimate the degree of reliability for each of the data elements as they are collected and integrates these signals to provide an accurate, individualized risk estimate of patient health over time in order to best guide patient treatment and allocation of hospital resources. Our initial target condition is sepsis, one of the most costly and most deadly diseases in hospitals. This grant develops an end-to-end system to provide risk assessment and implementation of timely treatment. For commercial potential, the underlying core technology can be extended to other clinical scenarios.     The proposed project enables scaling of high-precision state-of-the-art Bayesian machine learning techniques that forecast the chance of acute deterioration. This includes tackling the challenges in scaling this machine learning system to function across many care providers, patients, and hospitals. To achieve these goals, this project will develop new methods for running machine learning algorithms in a distributed fashion in cloud computing settings, especially in distinguishing where multiple machines need to coordinate, and arguably more importantly, where they can avoid coordinating in training on data. Further, the project develops software to provide information back to providers so as to enable interventions that can alter patient trajectory.

Data-tracking applications meant for public health are believed to yield hidden trends on diet, fitness, mood, and compliance in both individuals and populations, identifying behavioral patterns that may be useful for positive behavior change. With a far-reaching and accessible intervention leveraging the motivational power of games, empathy, and social interaction, health professionals can use this intervention to encourage long-term engagement with data-tracking, which in turn creates rich data sets for tapping into the unseen trends of T1D experiences, contributing to the growing body of T1D knowledge, enriching T1D youth's quality of life, and streamline patient-provider communications in a cost-effective way that benefits the health care system as a whole.    The proposed project aims to provide a better understanding of the affordances of digital technologies in DSM, with emphases on the role of technology as a facilitator of diabetes education, DSM, patient-provider communications, emotional wellness, social and cognitive development, and positive behavior change.

This will save lives and save money by preventing dose errors and wastage of costly medications and accessories when CSP's are incorrectly made. This I-Corps project will also explore similar problems that can also have life threatening consequences. The project will help to discern how various types of errors encountered in industrial processes can be minimized by integrating technology and human intervention at various workplaces. The product will help to gain understanding about how machines and people interact so as to design better workflow practices related to the CSP preparation and other relevant health care/industrial processes. The design of the technology allows usage in virtual simulation centers and other educational settings to train technical personnel, students, and professionals.    This I-Corps project involves a computational decision support system (CDSS) product that was developed to address severe shortcomings in compounded sterile preparations (CSP).

The first feature of the CDSS is an audio-visual interface for the compounding technician to identify and pick the correct materials and accessories to prepare a CSP. The second feature of the CDSS tracks, monitors, and evaluates the methods used by a technician compounding the injectable medication through image and video processing. The third feature of the CDSS checks and confirms the volume of a liquid injection contained in a syringe. The CDSS product can digitally document all the steps during this process enabling real time feedback during compounding so that errors can be corrected immediately. The technology also records the techniques used during compounding to ensure that proper procedures were followed according to regulatory guidelines.

For those models to be usable by scientists and clinicians who are experts in the biomedical phenomenon being modeled, it is important that the model features and activity be presented visually to make them understandable. This project seeks to develop a novel, modular computational approach to this challenge.  It will use modeling of the immune response to an important respiratory fungal infection as a test bed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.  This project will advance knowledge in computational modeling of biomedical systems and in the pathophysiology of infection. This particular infection has become increasingly relevant as it occurs most frequently in immuno-compromised individuals, including cancer and transplant patients. The developed model will examine how an individual's immune system interacts with the fungal spores to better understand the progression of this infection.  The eventual goal would be to take advantage of this improved understanding to spur the development of new treatments for this fungal infection.    This complexity of multiscale models of biomedical processes poses multiple challenges related to mathematical modeling, software design, validation, reproducibility, and extensibility. The computational goal of this project is to develop a novel modular approach to model architecture, using a recently introduced technology of lightweight virtual machines and a user-friendly open-source platform for the construction and linking of these so-called ""Docker containers"" to create complex modular models in a transparent fashion. A key benefit of software containers is that they can encompass the entire computational environment of a model, enabling unprecedented reproducibility of computational results.  For this project, this computational modeling will be focused on the development of a multiscale model capturing the early stages of invasive aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most common fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts and carries a poor prognosis. The spores of the causative organism, Aspergillus fumigatus, are ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Healthy hosts clear the inhaled spores without developing disease, but individuals with impaired immunity are susceptible to a life-threatening respiratory infection that can then disseminate to other organs. The increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies in transplantation and cancer has dramatically increased suffering and death from this infection, and this trend is expected to continue. The biomedical focus of the proposed project is the battle over iron between the fungus and the host. The overarching biomedical goal is to develop a simulation tool to explore the role of iron in invasive aspergillosis across biochemical and biophysical conditions.

Bone tissue grafts taken from the patient -- autografts -- are the gold standard, but require a second surgery and are limited in volume. Allografts, taken from a cadaver, have a fairly high failure rate after 10 years. Tissue engineered bone grafts hold promise, but have seen limited success due to the need of bone cells to see mechanical loading during the development and healing process in order to grow properly. This research project investigates the combination of hydrogels to encapsulate bone cells with low intensity pulsed ultrasound to provide controlled mechanical stimulation in order to enhance bone tissue development. The optimum combination of hydrogel stiffness and acoustic radiation force level is being determined first, and then the system is being tested in mice to determine whether or not it is effective for treating a bony defect when the ultrasound is applied through the skin. The project integrates students from high school through graduate and medical school into the research effort and introduces new course content into a biomaterials class.     The objectives of this research project are to evaluate the impact in vitro of RGD-modified alginate hydrogel stiffness and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound derived acoustic radiation force on encapsulated osteoblast behavior and to assess the efficacy, in vivo, of transdermally applied acoustic radiation force on osteoblasts encapsulated in an RGD-modified alginate hydrogel and implanted into a mouse cranial defect. Combinations of hydrogel stiffness and acoustic radiation force levels are being investigated to determine the optimum levels for upregulating phenotypic markers and mineralization of the encapsulated osteoblasts. The optimum system is then being utilized in a mouse cranial defect model, with ultrasound force applied daily for 20 minutes a four-week period.

In the fossil record, and among existing species, large morphological changes are frequently associated with changes in habitat or ecology. However, there remains little understanding of the general rules that govern morphological change associated with ecological change.

The project will exploit the group's multiple natural experimentation with extreme environments to develop detailed conceptual models for major ecological and morphological transitions that will inform on the rules underlying morphological change. These models will then serve as predictors for how and why transformations occur, which can be tested in other groups with similar narratives. Important examples include the initial emergence of four-limbed vertebrates onto land, how birds took the sky, and the first steps in the reign of mammals. The innovative technologies, techniques, and widely applicable conclusions from this research will promote interdisciplinary work among paleontologists, biomechanists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists.

Furthermore, this project will support associated PhD and Postdoctoral research as well as foster access to higher education for substantially underrepresented groups.    This project will use integrative approaches to reveal the complexities of ecomorphological changes across major evolutionary transitions. The study will examine how novel environments put new, often extreme demands on historical phenotypes by addressing how large-scale habitat and ecological transitions drive evolution across multiple integrated anatomical systems. The research will test hypotheses about phenotypic integration on an evolutionary scale to determine whether developmental rates, sequence heterochrony, and/or patterns of modularity determine if consistently applied rules of ecomorphological diversification underlie adaptive radiations. The outcome will be an unprecedented database of crocodylomorph cranial and post-cranial diversity that includes contrast-enhanced neural and skeletal tissues, raw and partitioned CT stacks, and 3D digital models as well as comparative, intra-clade conceptual models for how predatory vertebrates shift to lives on the shoreline, within the sea, and toward herbivory.

Incorporating embryo transfer into livestock breeding programs to maximize superior genetic traits can be economically advantageous to producers.  However, the only currently available means to select which embryo to transfer is subjective, invasive or expensive.  As most livestock producers cannot justify the cost of these available methods into their programs, the transfer of dead and low quality embryos into recipients, which will never establish a pregnancy, is common.  The technology developed with this project involves a noninvasive, cost-effective and quantitative method to select embryo viability and quality.  Using this technology to select which embryo to transfer will result in increased pregnancy rates after embryo transfer.  This technology will reduce costs spent on transferring non-viable embryos and caring for non-pregnant recipient animals.  This technology also provides the only published method to select which embryos have survived cryopreservation.

The cell will then move towards equilibrium with the media and water will enter the cell.  This increases the cellular density of the dead embryo, and results in a faster descent time than the descent time of a live embryo.  Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this technology to distinguish live from dead embryos in mouse zygotes, mouse cryopreserved blastocysts and cryopreserved sheep blastocysts.  Additional studies have demonstrated the technology does not harm embryos, as embryos continue development and establish healthy pregnancies after measured with the specific gravity device.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This chemical process produces manganese oxides that are widespread, highly reactive, efficient catalysts that play important roles in elemental biogeochemical cycles. Although these oxides are primarily made by microbial processes, the biological means for their formation are poorly understood. This project reveals the pathway of bacterial manganese oxide production, using the first purified active manganese-oxidizing enzyme complex. The project may uncover the biochemistry of how two processes-manganese oxidation and mineral formation-are achieved, laying the foundation for future application of biologically-derived manganese oxides in clean water technologies and energy storage and production. This project enhances the training of the next generation of scientists in interdisciplinary methods, and serves as a vehicle in outreach programs to engage undergraduate, middle, and high school students in studies of microbiology and biochemistry, as related to environmental science.  In addition, postdoctoral fellows develop a Saturday Academy course targeting either 6-8 or 9-12 grade students and focusing on the importance of microbiology and biochemistry as related to environmental science. The Saturday Academy provides professional development for the postdoctoral fellow as the instructor.    The project represents an investigation of how a purified protein can accomplish the difficult two-electron oxidation of Mn(II), forming a nanoparticulate MnO2 mineral product. Results to date indicate that the active protein belongs to the well-known multicopper oxidase family of enzymes, but with a unique ability to adapt the polynuclear chemistry of manganese to perform the catalysis. The research efforts are focused on establishing a molecular-level detailed mechanism of the catalysis, by resolving manganese oxidation intermediates and studying the effects of key mutations with an array of spectroscopic techniques. The spectroscopic studies are complemented by modeling, crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy work to derive the 3D atomic structure of the enzyme. In the context of broader environmental applicability, the research explores the effect of other metals occurring in the environment on the enzymatic catalysis of manganese oxidation.

Membrane-active antimicrobials represent a new family of promising antibiotic materials to address this crisis. They include a wide variety of small molecules, polymers, polypeptides, self-assembled structures, and organic-inorganic hybrid materials that kill bacteria by disrupting bacterial membranes. Since this mode of damage does not target specific biosynthetic pathways, the possibility of inducing bacterial resistance is greatly reduced. However, most current designs of membrane-active antimicrobials are not ready for applications yet because their hydrophobicity believed to be indispensable for breaking bacterial membranes also damages mammalian cells, which gives rise to their unacceptable toxicity. A critical but poorly understood question is how to design hydrophilic membrane-active antimicrobials that kill bacteria specifically without having to breach the hydrophobic cell membrane in general. Recent discovery of various membrane-active antibiotic nanomaterials suggests that nanostructure engineering could be another approach to develop membrane-active antimicrobials. The objective of this award is to adapt materials engineering, chemistry, and biological tools for the development of hydrophilic nanostructured antibiotic materials, and to elucidate the role of nanostructures on bacterial membrane remodeling. The successful outcomes of this award will pave the way for a potential paradigm shift to develop novel antibiotic materials with desirable activity, selectivity, and biocompatibility to fight bacterial resistance. Integrated with the research activities is a multi-tiered antimicrobial education program that will bring broad societal awareness on antibiotic resistance, and train next generation of scientists on the development of new antibiotic materials.     Technical Summary    The overall objective of this award is to adapt materials engineering, chemistry, and biological tools for the development of nanostructured membrane-active antibiotic materials (i.e., ""nanoantibiotics""), and to elucidate the role of nanostructures on bacterial membrane remodeling. The central hypothesis is that hydrophilic linear-chain polymers that do not breach the hydrophobic membrane interior but have poor antimicrobial activity can be transformed into potent antibiotic materials with high selectivity when assembled into nanostructures. This award will identify the role of multivalent interactions that drive this transformation, elucidate how nanostructure itself helps regulate antimicrobial activity and selectivity, and determine the feasibility of triple selectivity in the design of nanoantibiotics that will disintegrate and become inactive in response to environmental stimuli. This award will help open a door to transform diverse hydrophilic polymers that have excellent biocompatibility but weak antibiotic activity into potent nanostructured antibiotic materials. It will also reveal how to use physical dimensions of nanostructured membrane-active antibiotic materials as a simple tool to tune their activity and selectivity, potentially recruiting the latest development in both the bottom-up and top-down nanostructure engineering into antibiotic designs. Finally, it will examine a prototypical design of nanoantibiotics with dismantling ""switch"", shedding light on how to turn off antimicrobial activity ""on demand"" by disassembling antibiotic nanostructures after their service, hence reducing the prolonged presence of residue antibiotics in natural habitats that not only helps bacteria develop resistance, but also adversely impacts the ecosystems. This award will provide abundant training opportunities for postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students, and K12 participants in the interdisciplinary area of biology, chemistry, and materials science and engineering, support educational development on membrane-active antibiotic materials, and promote broad societal awareness on antibiotic resistance and antibiotic materials to diverse participants at all levels.

This project examines the conditions in which families and young learners most benefit from ""doing science and math"" together among a population that is typically underserved with respect to STEM experiences--families experiencing poverty. This project builds on an existing program called Teaching Together that uses interactive parent-child workshops led by a museum educator and focused on supporting STEM learning at home. The goal of these workshops is to increase parents'/caregivers' self-perception and ability to serve as their child's first teacher by supporting learning and inquiry conversations during daily routines and informal STEM activities. Families attend a series of afternoon and evening workshops at their child's preschool center and at a local children's museum. Parents/Caregivers may participate in online home learning activities and museum experiences. The project uses an experimental design to test the added value of providing incremental supports for informal STEM learning. The study uses an experimental design to address potential barriers parents/caregivers may perceive to doing informal STEM activities with their child. The project also explores how the quantity and quality parent-child informal learning interactions may relate to changes in children's science and mathematics knowledge during the pre-kindergarten year. The project partners include the Children's Learning Institute at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Children's Museum of Houston.     The project is designed to increase understanding of how parents/caregivers can be encouraged to support informal STEM learning by experimentally manipulating key aspects of the broader expectancy-value-cost motivation theory, which is well established in psychology and education literatures but has not been applied to preschool parent-child informal STEM learning. More specifically, the intervention conditions are designed to identify how specific parent supports can mitigate potential barriers that families experiencing poverty face. These intervention conditions include: modeling of informal STEM learning during workshops to address skills and knowledge barriers; materials to address difficulties accessing science and math resources; and incentives as a way to address parental time pressures and/or costs and thereby improve involvement in informal learning activities. Intervention effects will be calculated in terms of effect sizes and potential mediators of change will be explored with structural equation modeling. The first phase of the project uses an iterative process to refine the curriculum and expand the collection of resources designed for families of 3- to 5-year-olds. The second phase uses an experimental study of the STEM program to examine conditions that maximize participation and effectiveness of family learning programs. In all, 360 families will be randomly assigned to four conditions: 1) business-as-usual control; 2) the Teaching Together core workshop-based program; 3) Teaching Together workshops + provision of inquiry-based STEM activity kits for the home; and 4) Teaching Together workshop + activity kits + provision of monetary incentives for parents/caregivers when they document informal STEM learning experiences with their child. The interventions will occur in English and Spanish. A cost analysis across the interventions will also be conducted. This study uses quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data sources include parent surveys and interviews, conversation analysis of home learning activities, parent photo documentation of informal learning activities, and standardized assessments of children's growth in mathematics, science, and vocabulary knowledge.

Rosario-Ortiz    Collaborative Research: RAPID: Assessment of Water Quality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria    Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico (PR) on September 20th, 2017. This hurricane's legacy continues to harm many Puerto Rican citizens because of the devastating impact to this Island's infrastructure and the continuing struggle to rebuild it. Given the impacts that Hurricane Maria had on the water infrastructure, a unique and important opportunity exists to conduct a detailed evaluation of water quality issues related to the restoration of potable water service.  There are two main concerns. The first concern is regarding the water quality associated with centralized water treatment and distribution that is governed by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). In these systems, treatment issues associated with start-up and return to normalcy will likely cause unpredictable water quality that manifest itself in higher levels of potential pathogens, disinfection byproducts and other organic contaminants through water distribution. In addition, the integrity of the distribution system could be compromised by changes in water quality that mobilize metals and potential leakage points. These conditions result in an increased population exposure risk to potentially toxic or pathogenic agents, with potential for wide spread public health impacts. There is also the concern with the smaller community systems, that are not associated with PRASA. Here, contamination of surface water, combined with the collapse of the infrastructure, could have damaging effects.       The main objective of this RAPID proposal is to conduct a systematic survey and evaluation of water quality in several Puerto Rican potable water systems, focusing on both chemical and microbiological components. The main outcome from this project will be a point-of-use water quality retrospective of the near-term aftermath of Hurricane Maria, including an analysis of potential relationships between the chemistry and microbiology compromised water treatment and distribution systems. The proposed research will provide information on potential relationships chemical and microbiological agents in a seriously compromised tropical setting.

Joan,Curcio,Effects of retrotransposon activity on asymmetric cell division,2018-07-24,2018-08-01,2022-07-31,647064,"Retrotransposons are discrete segments of DNA (of viral origin) that contain all of the genetic information necessary to generate a copy of themselves and insert that copy back into the host cell DNA. The ability of retrotransposons to increase their copy number has ensured their success as invaders of host cell DNA in organisms from yeast to primates. The potentially mutagenic activity of retrotransposons is tightly suppressed in most cells, except those that divide asymmetrically, including stem cells and cells of the single-cell organism, brewer's yeast. Asymmetric cell division produces two cells with different potential, one with the capacity for self-renewal and the other with the capacity to perform specialized functions. A key requirement for asymmetric cell division is that each of these cells inherit a specific centrosome. The centrosomes comprise two intracellular bodies onto which chromosomes are anchored. Migration of the centrosomes, each with their complement of chromosomes, to opposite ends of a dividing cell ensures that chromosomes are equally distributed between the two cell products of cell division. The research outlined in this project stems from the investigagtor's discovery that stress-triggered retrotransposon activity in brewer's yeast interferes with the typical pattern of centrosome inheritance. The project will determine how the activity of retrotransposons influences the inheritance of a specific centrosome by the self-renewing cell and differentiated cell, and explores the consequences of disrupting the normal pattern of centrosome inheritance on chromosome segregation, cell division and the production of two cells with different potential. This research aims to explain how events occurring in single cells can influence the reproductive capacity and lifespan of the entire populations. The Broader Impact activities will include extensive laboratory-based training for a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, a high school student and also an undergraduate student to participate in the project each summer, with priority given to underrepresented minorities from institutions with limited research opportunities. The undergraduate research opportunity will focus on building self-identification as a research scientist, regardless of gender or racial representation in science.     Many types of asymmetrically dividing cells, including embryonic and germline stem cells, neural progenitors and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have a canonical pattern of centrosome or spindle pole body (SPB) inheritance that intrinsically regulates the orientation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome segregation and the capacity of cells to self-renew. Remarkably, these same asymmetrically dividing cell types are also permissive for the activity of retrotransposons, although host defense mechanisms usually hold retrotransposons in check to maintain the integrity of asymmetric cell division. It is not known how unleashing retrotransposon activity compromises asymmetric cell division. While examining the inherent asymmetry of nucleocapsid assembly sites of the Ty1 retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the principal investigator's laboratory discovered that derepressing Ty1 activity substantially perturbs the canonical pattern of SPB inheritance. The goal of this project is to understand how Ty1 retrotransposon activity influences SPB inheritance and how the resulting alterations in SPB inheritance affect spindle orientation, chromosome segregation and the self-renewing potential of yeast cells. Protein-protein interaction assays will be used to investigate the mechanism of cross-talk between Ty1 nucleocapsid components and SPB components, particularly the coiled-coil SPB assembly protein,  Spc42. Moreover, genetic and environmental manipulation of Ty1 retrotransposon activity and quantitative fluorescence microscopy-based assays of single cells will probe potential correlations between post-transcriptional steps in retrotransposition and (a) the SPB inheritance pattern, (b) the orientation of the mitotic spindle, (c) chromosome transmission fidelity, and (d) the replicative potential of mother and daughter cells. This research addresses a critical question that has not been addressed in the scientific literature previously: can sites of retrotransposon nucleocapsid assembly sequester host proteins with essential roles in SPB assembly to alter spindle orientation and the maintenance of differential cell fates by asymmetric cell division? Research to address this question will provide new insights into the relationship between retrotransposon activity and cell division.

This device allows safe training for events that might include loss of high intensity industrial radioactive sources (orphan sources) used in the oil drilling industry, radiological dispersal devices (RDD), radiological exposure devices (RED), nuclear accidents, or improvised nuclear devices (IND).      This I-Corps project uses RFID (radiofrequency identification) tags in combination with GPS (global positioning satellite) technology to mimic low-level to absolutely lethal level radiation without use of dangerous radioisotopes.  This is important because the vast majority of radiation training in the past has used low level actual radiation sources.  These sources pose both health and security risks.

This project's technology uses no ionizing radiation, and therefore is always as low as possible. This technology replicates high-intensity lethal radiation events that appear to be real on entry of first responders from a distance.

The 'oscillometric finger pressing method'is an emerging approach that uses the same measurement principle that is employed by most automatic cuff devices, but instead of inflating a cuff, the user presses his or her finger (and the underlying artery) against a combination of optical and pressure sensors to determine the blood pressure. The objectives of this program are to shrink the current prototype design and validate its accuracy. The proposed R&D plan includes miniaturization of the circuit components to mount them on a single board and optimization of the sensing technology and algorithm to work in a broad range of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. This work will be followed up by a clinical test of the monitor. The resulting device is expected to be small and thin enough to mount to the back of a smartphone and demonstrate clinical-grade accuracy for the measurement of blood pressure.

Through the use of models of osteoarthritis progression and how mechanical loading impacts disease onset, progression, and regression, combined with models of continuous, compliant and configurable prosthetics, the research team will develop a soft-robotic prosthetic that is capable of responding in real time, based on implanted sensors, to the changing pressures of the joint while moving, such that the optimal dislocation will be achieved to promote healing. The research brings together two radically different concepts and approaches: (1) that the manipulation of mechanical forces can bring about regeneration of the knee cartilage and be curative for osteoarthritis, and (2) through the novel use of a robotic system, precise determination of forces and precise manipulation of the knee joint environment can occur to provide evidence of repair and regeneration of the knee joint.      The research team will evaluate knee osteoarthritis as their testbed, but the program could have far reaching capabilities for other musculoskeletal disorders like hip-related osteoarthritis, gait-dependent back pain, and other disorders that would benefit from dynamic input rather than static control. Development of an engineered bioactive soft-robotic brace would be transformative to the field of musculoskeletal regeneration, as it is unlike any previous attempt to treat osteoarthritis. The approach is non-invasive, responds dynamically to the physical loads imposed upon the joint, is informed by the actual extent of disease progression of the joint, and is highly cost-effective. The project is high-risk, but may create a new engineered paradigm for the treatment of one of the world?s most prevalent diseases.

This technology identifies suspicious skin lesions as positive or negative for the structural properties of Buruli ulcers. Furthermore, this technique validates the classification system for other skin lesions which can be improved and expanded to include other types of skin diseases for humans, animals, and also plants. Point-of-care diagnostics for skin diseases have the potential to not only identify diseases in the early stages, but also create opportunities to initiate medical interventions in earlier stages of a disease, thereby reducing medical costs by treating diseases with antibiotic therapy instead of surgical interventions and eliminating any unnecessary pain and suffering resulting from complications of late-stage disease diagnosis. This innovation is critical for differential diagnosis, disease surveillance, collecting environmental contextual data, medication adherence, and advancing health literacy. This work is important because it contributes to a wider body of knowledge that seeks to validate algorithm development for point-of-care diagnostics, and ultimately improves access to healthcare for rural and hard-to-reach populations, also reducing barriers to care for otherwise stigmatizing and debilitating diseases.    Advancements in point-of-care diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases, and neglected infections of poverty represents an opportunity to decrease both the incidence and prevalence of debilitating and disfiguring diseases. These otherwise preventable diseases represent the most disability-adjusted life years lost. Representative of an interdisciplinary intervention, image diagnostics for skin diseases require the development of effective means for intervention design, management, and evaluation while enhancing the relationships and collaborations working internationally, across cultures, with community-based primary care, and to also include opportunities for incorporating telehealth to address access to care in resource-limited and hard-to-reach communities. Opportunities to more widely disseminate this research, and to include commercial potential expands the scope of this innovation and provides additional education and training opportunities for students of engineering and public health, but also for clinicians, and community-based healthcare providers. Successful implementation of point-of-care diagnostics for early stage disease detection advances the disciplines and allows for the translation of the innovation, analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of research for future education and training. Lastly, the advancement of this type of innovation has the ability to shift the medical system to early diagnosis reducing the overall disease burden of ill-health and disability due to late stage diagnosis of disease.

Previous scholarship on climate-human relationship focused on unique morphological and behavioral adaptations of early humans to hot, arid and open savanna habitats, and causally linked the dispersal of early humans with the development of savanna grasslands in Eurasia. However, evidence for an expansion of a savanna corridor at broad millennial temporal scales and/or at a global continental spatial scale is ambiguous and necessitates consideration that disparate climatic processes operating on narrower temporal scales and local spatial scales may have played a critical role in this cardinal and foundational event. Novel, state-of-the-art, complementary and interdisciplinary methods derived from archaeology and geosciences are well-placed to break new ground by focusing on seasonality and other high-resolution spatial and temporal climatic and environmental patterns as some of the driving forces for dispersal of early Homo. This collaboration of archaeologists, geochemists, paleontologists, and geologists from the United States, Israel, Republic of Georgia, and Australia will explore the unfamiliar pattern of seasonality, climate and environment which early humans faced in the Levant. Knowledge of the type, extent and degree of past biological human adaptation holds promise for illuminating issues on the distributions and capacities of modern humans in varying climatic regimes. Anthropogenic climate change is one of the most perilous processes facing humanity in the 21st century and understanding human biological limits is paramount in addressing these global concerns. The research will provide a platform for fostering professional and public discourse on the interactions throughout time among climate, environment, and human responses, enhancing science education across multiple academic levels, and supporting the recruitment of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through mentoring aimed to create leaders in scholarship, research and public life.     The research team will derive new data on the local climate and environment of two archaeological sites in Israel and the Republic of Georgia dating from 2 - 1.2 million years ago, which are the some of the earliest sites of humans out of Africa. Combining new dating methods, archaeological excavations, fossil analyses across the spectra of morphology, histology and chemistry will permit rigorous evaluation of the links between climate, environment and hominin population dynamics.

For example, numerous experimental labs study how the strengths of synaptic connections and their dynamics affect cognition by establishing empirical correlations between in vitro electrophysiology measurements and data collected in animal behavioral experiments. However, these correlations fall short of causal explanations: to date, there exist no mechanisms connecting recordings in individual neurons and synapses with cognitive learning dynamics. The problem is not due to a lack of observations at either the neuronal or the systemic level; rather, it reflects a principal gap in our ability to link these two scales. Even if a full description of every neuron in the brain could be produced, there would still be a gap in our ability to transition from local data to making qualitative conclusions about how it combines to produce systemic cognitive outcomes. Addressing this problem requires a conceptual framework encompassing a computational model that would link the experimentally derived characteristics of individual cells with effects of those characteristics at the ensemble level.     The proposed research aims to provide a way to establish such a connection: developing a data-driven, systemic model of hippocampal spatial learning based on the parameters of the hippocampal synaptic architecture, including the parameters of synaptic plasticity, using novel topological and geometric techniques. Recent developments in Algebraic Topology will be used to integrate the parameters of synaptic connectivity and synaptic plasticity (e.g., long- and short-term potentiation and depression), to study structure of this map, the mechanisms of its formation and deterioration, and to evaluate the time required to produce a spatial map of a given environment, etc. This project is a natural evolution of prior work done by the Dabaghian group on modeling the mechanisms of spatial learning, based on algebraic topology methods developed by the M?moli group. The theory-based insight into learning phenomena will produce a qualitatively better understanding of how to interpret data, how to design new experiments, what variables should be targeted in measurements, as well as how to minimize use of animals, and in general how to optimize use physical and intellectual resources.

Current in vitro methods for characterizing gastrointestinal absorption are based on unreliable assays, with 90% of all drugs developed ultimately failing to enter the market. Practically, these limitations delay the development of critically needed therapeutic drugs and dramatically increase drug prices and health care costs. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop more predictive in vitro testing assays that will allow for early selection of the most promising drug candidates to reduce the number of live animal studies and their associated costs, while accelerating transition from pre-clinical research to early drug development. The technology is based on the discovery, fundamental characterization and bioarchiving of adult canine intestinal stem cell lines, called 3-dimensional (3D) canine intestinal organoids. These miniguts emulate the physiology of the functional intestine much more closely than currently available methods and have the potential to provide superior drug screening over currently used assays.     This SBIR Phase I is a proposal to establish that in vitro predictability of oral drug absorption can be improved using canine intestinal organoids vs. standard 2D in vitro assays, such as Caco2 and MDCK cell lines. In Aim 1, the goal is to determine intestinal absorption and permeability of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment as compared with conventional in vitro models. This will be achieved by quantifying passive and active permeability of drugs, as well as drug transporter expression and function in 3D canine organoids vs. conventional cell systems. In Aim 2, the goal is to determine intestinal metabolism of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment in canine organoids compared to standard in vitro models. Ultimately, quantitative data generated through these experiments will be imported into a commercial software to simulate the disposition kinetics of a predefined set of candidate drugs. Performances of the model predictions will be evaluated by comparing simulated vs. observed drug kinetic plasma data from the literature for validation purposes.

The healthcare system is plagued by inefficiencies, many of which boil down to the inability to access the right data at the right time because of technological and business barriers. Leveraging blockchain for data access can drive an identified $100 billion in savings. However, while an estimated 40% of senior finance executives expect their firm to invest in blockchain over the next 2 years because of its transformational qualities, the transaction speed of blockchain needs to be improved. This project addresses this need, bringing a critical scaling innovation to Health Nexus - the open source, HIPAA-compatible blockchain.

There are excellent protocols for the management and treatment of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once patients have been admitted into the healthcare system. Health care providers, however, have limited interaction with their patients, and these interactions occur in the highly constrained environment of the clinical setting. Physicians have limited control over patient behavior and limited ability to recognize stroke symptoms outside the clinical setting. For patients with high stroke risk, there is currently no system available to monitor stroke symptoms and initiate a response in real-time. Thus, there is a need to monitor patients remotely, where the current systems for stroke response fail to provide coverage. The proposed solution will expand the provision of stroke symptom monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking patients as they go through their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge of stroke and will allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases.     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the real-time detection of stroke. Ischemic stroke affects 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours for these treatments, respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying symptoms of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge. The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational solution to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency response in a timely manner. The solution will consist of a wearable device with multiple modalities, which are fed to a smartphone and a cloud-based analysis system for real-time analysis and detection. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies.

In recent years, new and challenging problems have emerged from diverse fields such as business, social sciences, and health sciences.  Examples may involve prediction of a health outcome for a new patient or perhaps prediction of a new school's response to efforts to educate children about smoking prevention.  The investigators have shown in previous work called classified mixed model prediction (CMMP) that in such cases, it is possible to make substantial gains in prediction accuracy by identifying a class that a new subject belongs to.  However, the scenarios under which CMMP currently operates are somewhat constrained and many real-life situations fall outside its scope.  Given the tremendous gains in accuracy that are possible, it would be very valuable to develop further methodology and computational advances to deepen knowledge in this area.        This project aims to make methodological advances of the classified mixed model prediction method into other types of subject-level prediction problems as well as to develop new inferential methods along the CMMP idea, by making the latter truly useful in practical situations.  The basic idea of CMMP is to create a ""match"" between a group or cluster in the population for which one wishes to make prediction and a (massive) training dataset, with known groups or clusters. Once such a match is built, the traditional mixed model prediction method can be utilized to make accurate predictions. The practical challenges that will be solved in this project include i) how to deal with training data with unknown grouping; ii) how to deal with sparse, high dimensional covariates; iii) how to make better use of covariate information to improve accuracy of CMMP; and iv) how to provide accurate measures of uncertainty for CMMP-type predictions. Two important areas of application will be investigated.  One is in precision medicine and health disparities focusing on the prediction of epigenetic markers using high dimensional genotype profiles. The other comes from the area of family economics using a large survey of data from China where predictions at finer levels of resolution (e.g., households) are of primary interest.

Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations in cost, sensitivity, and accessibility of current screening result in missing 1 in 3 cancers at early stages. Early detection is associated with lower costs of treatment that save billions of dollars in direct medical care and lost productivity annually, demonstrating a clear economic and societal benefit for better breast cancer screening platforms. The technology leverages the proven benefits of automated ultrasound and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence to expand the deployment of these systems, including lower-resource settings such as walk-in or rural clinics, pharmacies, and in the home for self-monitoring. The platform's portability, low cost, 2-minute scan time, automated analysis, and patient-centered design greatly increases the accessibility and adoption of breast cancer screening, resulting in better clinical outcomes and a reduced cost burden to the US healthcare system.

The knowledge gained will support an improved understanding of how and why cardiac atrophy occurs, which may lead to improved treatment strategies.  The project will also develop a workshop for K12 students around tissue engineering on the international space station as well as implement a seminar for medical students, interns, and residents about the benefits and challenges of transitioning research from an Earth-based laboratory into space.    Two objectives have been established for this project.  First, to compare and contrast the morphology, viability, and altered energy metabolism in 3D bioprinted cardiac organoids under microgravity and Earth's gravity.  Second, to study the epigenetic changes in 3D bioprinted cardiac organoids under microgravity and assess how these changes may affect the development of cardiac atrophy when compared to Earth's gravity.  Specifically, the team will engineer and validate a chip design for culturing of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells to investigate underlying biological and signaling mediators responsible for damage to cells during microgravity exposure, leading to possible cardiac atrophy. Findings may suggest that epigenetic events could be one of the mechanistic bases for microgravity&#8208;induced gene expression changes related to cardiac atrophy and may facilitate the development of countermeasures to prevent the adverse effects of microgravity or other atrophy-inducing pathologies.

The technology involves obtaining patient cancer cells and through a process of biomineralization and surface adsorption with danger signals (i.e. adjuvants already used in clinical use) transforms the cells into potent cancer vaccines. The potential for a durable benefit with this approach in women with ovarian cancer is supported by data demonstrating that successful induction of an anti-tumor immune response has a significant impact on long-term survival and by early results from prior vaccine trials. Following isolation of cancer cells, the process can be completed in less than 24 hours, without the need for cell culture or genetic alteration, reducing risks and costs of production. The personalized cancer vaccine is stable to storage and dehydration, and thus is available for immediate and future use and can be transported without the need for cold storage.    This I-Corps project seeks to further develop a cancer vaccine that is not an incremental advance in vaccine design, rather it would transform both the production and distribution of cancer vaccines to facilitate the integration of immune therapy into current treatment protocols. Seventy percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have advanced disease. While chemotherapy offers some initial release, the majority of patients relapse. Currently no therapeutic alternatives exist, making the need for better alternatives extreme. The proposed technology transforms patient cancer cells into pathogen mimics by decorating the cell surface with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These patterns activate immune cells to attack and kill the cancer cells. Preclinical testing in mice has demonstrated that administration of the vaccine prior to tumor growth prevents tumor engraftment in all vaccinated mice. Furthermore, early studies show that treatment of mice with established ovarian cancer results in elimination of cancer in 75% of the subjects, with a partial response in the remaining. Future dose optimization and combinatorial testing with immune checkpoint blockade are expected to further improve on the technology.

Ontologies have been widely used for orchestrating the coding, management, exchange, and sharing of the increasingly large amounts of digital data produced by the biomedical research enterprise. For example, SNOMED CT, one of the largest and most complex biomedical ontologies, supports the development of high-quality electronic health records and facilitates patient subgroup identification, clinical decision support, and healthcare delivery quality measurement. Given such important roles that biomedical ontologies play, quality issues (such as incompleteness in coverage of subclasses), if not addressed, can affect the quality of diagnoses and decisions. However, incompleteness issues such as missing hierarchical relations and missing concepts are infeasible to be addressed by manual work alone due to the size and complexity of biomedical ontologies. The goal of this project is to develop automated and scalable approaches for identifying potential incompleteness issues as well as suggesting solutions to fix them. This project will incorporate the computational aspects of the proposed work into curriculum development and educational offerings related to data science and promote women participation in data science.    To audit and enhance completeness of ontologies, this project explores the following research tasks: (1) Development of a robust reasoning framework for detecting and repairing missing subclass or hierarchical relations. This will result in suggestions that directly enhances the subclass completeness of ontologies; (2) Development of novel methods for identifying missing concepts and creating appropriate name labels for the identified missing concepts. This will result in enhancement in the concept completeness of ontologies; (3) Generation of supporting evidence for suggested solutions by leveraging rich extrinsic knowledge. For further verification of the robustness of the proposed approaches, domain experts will be involved in validation of the discovered incompleteness issues. The proposed approaches are applied to three large ontologies in biomedicine: SNOMED CT, Gene Ontology, and NCI Thesaurus. Suggested ontology changes will be communicated to the respective ontology owners for incorporation in subsequent versions.

Most researchers spend several years training under just one or two graduate and/or postdoctoral mentors, suggesting that these few relationships can have a large impact on scientific careers. Mentorship can provide both direct intellectual benefits to the trainee, through the learning of new skills and concepts, and indirect social benefits, through engagement with the social network of the mentor. Given the importance of mentorship in scientific career development, this aspect of training may play an important role in determining access of underrepresented groups to scientific careers. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impact of demographic variables--such as gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background--on the outcome of scientific training.    Networks of mentors and trainees can be represented by a directional graph resembling a traditional family tree. This project develops a large crowdsourced database of academic mentorship relationships, and links that data to databases that measure scientific productivity (publications and grants) and demographic variables. Graph theoretic and semantic tools will be used to determine if and how demographic variables, associated with both of the mentor and trainee, impact scientific productivity. A preliminary analysis of gender replicates previous reports of bias toward representation male researchers, especially at more senior career stages. Accurately modeling effects of demographic variables requires accounting for other variables that impact scientific productivity metrics, namely differences between fields and long-term temporal trends. This project will use semantic analysis of publication data to develop the concept of the ""intellectual neighborhood"" of mentors. and incorporate this into the modeling of career outcomes. Data will be made open-access for general use by the public, providing a new resource for studying the dynamics of research fields.

Current sampling technology is limited to degraded stool samples and to invasive endoscope sampling that, in humans, cannot reach the distal small intestines. The technology developed here offers a non-invasive system for sampling gastrointestinal microbiota in their localized environment for discovery, characterization, medical research, diagnostics, and treatment never before possible. There will potentially be a new paradigm in human and animal health for microbiome research and commercial applications.  Initial application focus will be on the unmet needs of human gastroenterology and the human microbiome.    This I-Corps project further develops a non-invasive ingestible, non-digestible capsule used to sample digestive tract microbiome.  It is placed inside an immediate or delayed release outer capsule. When the outer capsule dissolves according to its specifications, enteric fluid and content enters the sampling capsule through its ports triggering a hydrophilic stop to release a pulling force, closing the ports, capturing the sample, holding it sealed until it completes passage through the digestive track, and recovered from the feces for analysis. The novel capsule device has a competitive advantage because it can take samples in their localized environment and it can access the restrictive areas of the small intestines.

From a commercial standpoint, the technology provides the benefits of longer shelf-lives, cleaner and more accurate results, enhanced customization options, and improved delivery times to the customer. These value propositions work to significantly improve and expand existing methods (such as flow cytometry and microscopy) that utilize the technology to determine immune responses in pre-clinical/clinical specimens. The primary customer segment for this technology would include life science researchers in industry developing cutting-edge vaccines or gene-engineering T cells. Altogether, the advances this technology provides will directly impact patients and society by more effectively facilitating the creation and adoption of clinically appropriate therapies.

Cryo-EM produces high-resolution 3D images at microscopic levels and is used by researchers in many fields including life sciences, materials science, nanotechnology, semiconductors, energy, environmental science, and food science. Microscopy advancements enable molecular image capture at unprecedented levels of resolution, but the data produced are growing exponentially and subsequent processing of those images into visible 3D structures is both challenging and time consuming. Each project can produce more than 100,000 images and take weeks to arrive at one viewable 3D structure. Current image processing and data analysis solutions are not well-integrated, requiring extensive manual user involvement and long wait times before assessing image quality. We will apply machine learning to automate cryo-EM image processing to improve researcher productivity and accuracy.  We will also design the system to reduce user training time.   The result will improve access to cryo-EM and accelerate new breakthroughs in many areas of science.      This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project automates image processing for single particle analysis by developing new machine learning models that recognize particles with repeatable accuracy levels and integrates them into the cryo-EM workflow for easy deployment. Images generated by cryo-EM are highly noisy, and the goal is to process them to build recognizable 3D molecular structures. Many steps in the cryo-EM workflow require manual intervention and analysis that can take several weeks and result in errors due to user bias, time waiting and user fatigue. The objectives of this research are to produce a prototype that consistently and accurately predicts particles and is easily integrated into the cryo-EM workflow.

While the technology is primarily intended to treat chronic subdural hematomas, it may have a role in treating other types of brain hemorrhage, infection, and cancer. A chronic subdural hematoma is a fluid collection containing blood breakdown products and is located between the brain and its covering called the dura. Current treatment for such fluid collections typically involves surgery to evacuate the fluid collection through holes or surgical removal of bone pieces of varying sizes, followed by irrigation and drain placement. This is the one of the most common neurosurgical procedures. Recovery is often prolonged, and recurrence can be common. There is a significant need for less invasive and more effective treatments. A less invasive treatment would allow for an effective bedside procedure, reducing the cost associated with a major brain surgery and facilitating recovery.  Reduction in recurrence rates is expected to lead to improved health, reduced disability and increased independence in patients, and reduce costs associated with repeat hospitalizations and procedures.    This I-Corps project is aimed at determining the commercial potential of a device for evacuating abnormal fluid collections in the brain. The device is a system that allows for continuous irrigation of areas in the head with control of the pressure and monitoring of the fluid. The desgn allows for percutaneous bedside placement of bolts connected to catheters and a pump that replaces the chronic subdural hematoma with normal cerebrospinal fluid.  Access is minimally invasive, and the approach is designed to be a bedside procedure. Next steps in the development include plans to test the prototype device in biophysical brain models.

Specifically, the research investigates how people affected by opioids create new ways of caring and relating to one another in opioid-affected communities that have access to mutual aid groups to provide support that is otherwise lacking. The project will reveal priorities of opioid-affected individuals in seeking care and support, thus informing attempts to aid in their recovery. Specifically, leveraging lessons learned via observing how users care for each other will provide insights into ways to model interventions for supportive care networks for recovery in the United States.     The research is informed by and advances kinship theory and medical anthropology by considering two research questions: (1) How do the dynamics of shifting family support influence the decisions and behavior of individuals affected by opioid addiction? (2) What differences are seen in mutual aid associations compared with other networks in care practices, relationships, and experiences? To address these questions the study employs systematic observations and interviews with care practices in network interactions, analyzes the affective flows and discourses within and between care subnetworks, and uses personal-network questionnaires that characterize relationships among individuals affected by opioid addiction as part of their broader social networks. Results from the project will provide insights into the operation of mutual aid organizations through offering new strategies of harm reduction and their deployment that can have an influence on opioid policy and caregiving. The multi-level characterization of networks of kin and non-kin will refine anthropological understandings of the contexts that give rise to support versus divestment in kin, and how networks are broken and rebuilt as allegiances shift due to opioid addiction.

Thus, the manganese cycle—the interconversion between bioavailable Mn ions (Mn(II)) and insoluble Mn oxide minerals (MnO2)—is globally important. Microorganisms play a significant part in driving the manganese cycle: some bacteria use MnO2 for respiration, in the process converting the mineral to dissolved Mn(II), while other bacteria can oxidize Mn(II), forming the MnO2 deposits that can be found in many environments. The latter process, biomineralization, is a less-understood field in manganese biogeochemistry. With this award, Dr. Bradley Tebo and Dr. Thomas Spiro will develop a comprehensive picture of bacterial manganese oxide biomineralization, which is essential for understanding how MnO2 are processed in nature, and how this insight might be applied to the burgeoning uses of MnO2 minerals in environmental remediation and bioenergy production. The project will enhance the training of the next generation of scientists and embrace outreach activities, including mentoring students and programs that seek to attract underserved/underrepresented middle and high school students to science majors. A set of artistic illustrations to communicate the project to a broader audience will be created and made available through various channels.    In many Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria, multicopper oxidase (MCO) enzymes have been implicated to be the catalysts for Mn(II) oxidation. In Mn(II)-oxidizing Bacillus species, dormant spores oxidize Mn(II) and form MnO2 minerals, catalyzed by MCOs residing in the exosporium—a complex structure that surrounds the spores. However, the molecular mechanism of MnO2 production remains to be elucidated. With the first purified bacterial manganese oxidizing complex, Mnx, and a collection of manganese-oxidizing bacteria, this project will reveal how bacteria control the formation of MnO2 nanoparticles. Specifically, investigators will characterize how the protein guides the formation of mineral units, how they are expelled into the solution and further grow to form the mineral found in nature, and how complexities of natural environment—biological matter of whole cells, complexing agents, and dissolved iron—affect the final biomineral. The project is highly leveraged through a collaborative and integrated approach of multiple state-of-the-art techniques, including cryoEM, SAXS, EXAFS, liquid-cell TEM, and computational methods to offer a unique molecular-level view of manganese oxide biomineralization. Additionally, the project will expand the use of state-of-the-art microscopic techniques, primarily used in biomedical and materials science research, to address questions of geochemical significance.

The cells and tissues that make up living organisms have material properties just like any other substance. When exposed to mechanical forces, such as pulling or pushing, they stretch and change shape. They can even generate these forces themselves.  The material properties of cells are controlled by the cytoskeleton, a collection of filamentous proteins. This network of filaments gives cells their shape, much like the skeleton defines the human shape. In cells, however, this network is dynamic and adaptive, reorganizing itself to help cells perform various functions or to resist outside mechanical stresses. The cytoskeleton thus represents a new class of material that doesn't obey the traditional models of engineering materials. It can modulate its material properties in both space and time.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will determine how the cell is able to spatially and temporally regulate its material properties and unearth novel design principles that can be used to develop new engineering materials and to understand how some diseases affect cell behavior. Sitting at the interface between physics, biology, and engineering, this multi-disciplinary work will inform research across a broad spectrum of fields. Most importantly, it will create opportunities for a diverse set of students and young researchers to develop innovative skills and perspectives, in particular learning to communicate novel methods and ideas across disciplines.     The cytoskeleton is a model system for developing insights into non-equilibrium mechanics and network dynamics, and is known to both generate and respond to mechanical signals. Despite the fact that the principal molecular biochemical interactions have been well detailed, we still lack an understanding of how macroscopic scale behaviors emerge from the collection of many molecular interactions. Septins are the least studied filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. They bind to both actin and the plasma membrane, and have been shown to localize specifically to regions of actin curvature and mechanical stress. This research project will test the hypothesis that septins help to regulate the material properties of the cytoskeleton by altering the local architecture. This work will measure the material properties of septin-actin networks in both living cells and purified protein networks, and test the response of these networks to mechanical perturbations such as micropatterning to control cell shape, traction force microscopy, and optogenetics to induce local contractions. In addition to potentially uncovering novel mechanisms to regulate cell shape, this work will also generate insight into how molecular interactions in a network are integrated into macroscopic behaviors.

Brine fly larvae and brine shrimp must maintain a much lower salt content than their environment, which is an energetically costly process. However, the cellular mechanisms by which they achieve this unique feat are poorly understood. The work in this project will deduce how these two organisms adapt cellular mechanisms to retain water and expel salt within environments that strongly favor the opposite. The ability to compare and contrast the mechanisms utilized by these substantially different species to combat this environmental stress will provide critical insights into their adaptation. This collaborative study links research and teaching at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and Illinois State University and will immerse graduate and undergraduate students in a rigorous and interdisciplinary educational setting, providing 1) a project-research-based course and 2) continuing laboratory research opportunities for undergraduates, thus creating a pathway to recruit  undergraduate students into biological research. in addition to their standard training in research methods.  The graduate students involved in the research efforts will also be provided with unique training on how to teach (within a course) and to become a mentor (within the laboratory). Thus, this project accomplishes a multilevel training experience that reinforces scientific skills at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, while providing training to graduate students as future mentors and faculty members. The results from this project will be disseminated by peer-reviewed publications, invited lectures, and presentations at scientific meetings.    The ion-transport mechanisms that allow brine shrimp and brine fly larvae adaptation to extreme salinities remain largely unknown. This project utilizes novel integration of bioinformatics, biochemistry, and electrophysiology, to identify such ion- transporters, study their functional properties, and uncover their role and cooperation to allow these animals to thrive in an environment where all other animals die. Several hypotheses organized in three independent research aims will be tested: 1) Identify the ion transporters required for brine shrimp survival in high salinity 2) Identify the ion-transporters required for brine fly survival in high salinity 3) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms of amino acid substitutions linked to salinity adaptation. For aims 1 & 2, target ion-transport proteins will be identified in each organism by transcriptomics, and their functional role evaluated by pharmacological survival assays and siRNA methods and by expression of the identified transporters in heterologous expression systems. An essential player in the adaptation of all osmoregulating animals is the Na,K-ATPase. Most animals that adapt to both ends of the extreme salinity spectrum present radical structural modifications in regions that are critical for the interaction of the transported ions with this protein. To test if and how these modifications may provide an adaptive advantage to the extreme salinity-adapting animals that carry them, the third aim of this project specifically evaluates the stoichiometry and functional properties of Na,K-ATPases with the same structural specialties as those observed in adapting animals.

Neuroanatomical anatomical differences between people affected by these conditions and “typically developing” individuals have been identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the biological mechanisms leading to such differences, and their link to the disease processes, are incompletely understood. It is safe to perform MRI on pregnant women, and recent developments in the ability to account for fetal motion during image acquisition, have enabled high-resolution 3D imaging of the fetal brain. In order to better understand the developmental mechanisms that underlie the trajectory of anatomical changes observed by MRI in humans, longitudinal measurements are also collected in nonhuman primates. Human and nonhuman primates share many similarities in both brain structure and function that allow findings in one to be translated to the other. Advantages of nonhuman primate studies are that many factors that may vary between human pregnancies can be experimentally controlled, and much more detailed longitudinal imaging is possible. This research will develop computational approaches to more precisely link fetal growth between human and nonhuman brains. The work leverages unique human and nonhuman primate imaging datasets with new methods for systematically labeling the brain into corresponding sub-regions and establish closer links between developmental events. This increased precision will enhance knowledge gained from ongoing human observational studies and enable new clinical approaches to address neurodevelopmental diseases.     The ability to non-invasively monitor fetal brain growth in both human and nonhuman primates using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a new opportunity to characterize brain development with longitudinal experimental designs. However, given the increased frequency with which data can be acquired, and quality of high-resolution images, an important new limitation is the inability to translate developmental time points between species at the level of precision of the acquired data. Conventional approaches for studying postnatal brain images utilize processing steps such as spatial normalization to a common anatomical coordinate frame, segmentation into tissue classes, and parcellation into known neuroanatomical regions. Adaptation of these techniques to study the developing fetal brain requires age and species-specific definitions for quantities such as transient developmental zones, or emergence of cortical gyri and sulci. This project makes use of increasingly powerful machine learning techniques and leverages the increasingly rich fetal imaging data now being collected, to extract consistent cross-species measures of brain development. An additional objective is to develop fine scale anatomically and temporally consistent definitions across species. These neuroanatomically localized definitions will then be used to quantify regional morphometric growth during fetal brain development in both species. This work contributes to the computational science and the neuroscience that supports neuroimaging studies of fetal brain development. These developments will provide a new translational resource to link anatomically and temporally specific information about brain development, both in normal growth and in clinical and animal model experiments focused on neurodevelopmental disorders.

However, most adaptive randomization designs either do not make good use of the available covariates or depend on unnecessary model assumptions, so the current state of adaptive designs does not match the data-rich environment. This project seeks to develop new theory and methodology for adaptive designs to streamline clinical trials by efficiently incorporating a vast amount of covariate information without model misspecification. The success of the project will allow a large quantity of available data to be utilized in adaptive designs, and trial participants to avoid unnecessary unsafe exposure. The research will have broad impacts on general experimental designs and their applications in fields such as product quality, food industry, energy and architecture, and computer simulation models. The PI will integrate research and education by promoting the adaptive designs among students, researchers, physicians, and project managers through courses and presentations, involving women and underrepresented minority students in research, and making presentations at minority-serving institutions.     The project will focus on three main research directions. First, the PI plans to develop a new family of semiparametric covariate-adjusted response-adaptive (CARA) designs as well as analysis approaches that can achieve the objectives related to efficiency and ethics and incorporate many covariates without model misspecification. Second, in many fields, scientists are more interested in the tail quantiles than the mean. In addition, quantile inference is often a secondary analysis in clinical trials, allowing researchers and policymakers to detect the points along the distribution that may be the most amenable to the new treatment.

While climatic pressures are widely cited as contributing to global variation in human head shape, torso dimensions, limb proportions, and overall body size, specific links between physical features and body function in different environmental conditions have not been experimentally established. Furthermore, studies of adaptation to climate have historically focused on separate regions of the body (e.g. braincase, nose, torso, upper limb, lower limb), with minimal attention to how these different anatomical structures interact with one another to function as a whole. To remedy this, the research uses state-of-the-art technologies, including computed tomography imaging and an environmental chamber simulating different climactic conditions, to measure the physiological responses of physically diverse living participants. Validation of proposed thermoregulatory benefits of specific body forms is essential for guiding future research on adaptation.

The use of blockchain technology drives efficiencies in direct alignment with improved patient experience and improved health, both at a reduced cost. The economic impact of bringing down the costs of providing healthcare has the potential to benefit millions of lives. One serious threat on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is the double-spend attack. With a successful double-spend attack, miners can reverse payments and obscure the audit trail of data access. The deployment of the proposed protocol will ensure the integrity of both these properties. More broadly, the proposed system can improve security for any PoW blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The system can also greatly improve user experience by processing in a timely and standard manner via regularly created blocks.    This STTR Phase II project proposes to virtually remove the threat of double-spends for healthcare safe blockchains. Existing PoW blockchains are based on computational puzzles. Once a miner solves a puzzle, she adds a block to the chain and is rewarded with coins. In expectation, miners produce blocks proportional to their share of the computational resources. But mining is a random process and occasionally a miner with a small share of the resources can generate a majority of the blocks. In those cases, a minority miner can overwrite existing blocks, nullifying or double-spending earlier entries. The proposed system prevents double-spend attacks by requiring miners to aggregate multiple solutions to the PoW problem before submitting a block. This aggregation ensures that miners with the majority of the processing power have a high probability of submitting the majority of the blocks, reducing the risk of double-spends by orders of magnitude. The technical work includes:  First, developing a new consensus mechanism for blockchains. The consensus mechanism is a highly sensitive, embedded piece of software and this adoption will be handled with careful engineering. Second, the project will decrease associated bandwidth use on the network, a primary cost. The project will seek to create a new solution for reducing network costs based on advanced filters. Third, the project will address and mitigate remaining security issues, such as proof withholding attacks and Denial of Service attacks. Finally, the work will empirically quantify the improvements to ensure high quality engineering and to inform translation strategy.

Real-time location traces of individuals can be used to significantly speed up and scale up contact tracing.  However, such use also heightens concerns on individual privacy and data abuse.  Urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a careful balance of privacy protection with public health benefits.  This project aims to develop techniques and a mobile application, REACT, for REAal-time Contact Tracing and risk monitoring via privacy-enhanced tracking of users' locations and symptoms.  To enhance privacy, users can control and refine the frequency and granularity with which their information will be collected and used.  REACT will enable: 1) contact tracing of individuals and locations that a confirmed case has contact with for quarantine and decontamination to control further spread, 2) individual risk monitoring based on the locations they visit and their contact with others so they can be informed and alerted; and 3) community risk monitoring and detection of early signals of community spread to prepare for larger-scale infections.

This project focuses on the relatively unexplored process of cell-cell communication via microRNAs. A major roadblock to understanding microRNA-mediated cell-cell communication has been the inability to distinguish microRNAs produced by donor and recipient cells. This project will employ an innovative approach to get around this roadblock. The successful completion of this work will lead to a better understanding of microRNA-mediated cell-cell communication and a new set of resources and tools for investigating cell-cell interactions in a variety of organisms, including humans.    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with significant regulatory roles in all physiological processes. miRNAs were thought to be stable only inside cells and rapidly degraded by enzymes when outside the cell. Recent work has demonstrated that this is not the case: cells can export miRNAs through multiple mechanisms, affecting other cells either next door or at great distances away. Past work has typically focused on one miRNA at a time because it is impossible to distinguish miRNA molecules made by one cell from those made by another. Major questions remain unanswered: Which miRNAs are transferred? What mechanisms do cells use to transfer them? To overcome hurdles and answer these questions, expertise in miRNA biology, synthetic biology and genome editing will be leveraged. Two features of non-mammalian systems will be adopted: a protozoan enzyme to label RNA, and CRISPR/Cas to engineer custom genetic circuits and introduce genome modifications. Combining cells engineered to label RNA with those that do not label RNA will enable the identification of miRNA species that are transferred between cells. Implementation and stable integration of custom synthetic biology circuits in human cells will permit the reliable monitoring of miRNA levels. Selective pharmacological blocking of inter-cellular communication mechanisms will facilitate the determination of how such transfer occurs. Genome editing will allow pinpointing which genes involved in specific transfer mechanisms are the critical determinants of miRNA exchange between cells. The long-term goal is to address questions about how cells communicate with each other. Successful completion of the proposed work will identify miRNAs that mediate cell-cell communication and generate a new set of resources and tools for investigating the relationship between cells in many different models of human biology.

There are excellent protocols for the management and treatment of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once patients have been admitted into the healthcare system. Ischemic stroke affects 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Health care providers, however, have limited interaction with their patients, and these interactions occur in the highly constrained environment of the clinical setting. Physicians have limited control over patient behavior and limited tools to help patients recognize stroke symptoms outside the clinical setting. For patients with high stroke risk, there is currently no system available to monitor stroke symptoms and initiate a response in real-time. Thus, there is a need to monitor patients remotely, where the current systems for stroke response fail to provide coverage. The proposed solution will expand the provision of stroke symptom monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking patients as they go through their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge of stroke and will allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases.     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the real-time detection of stroke.  IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy.

Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying symptoms of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge. The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational solution to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency response in a timely manner. The solution consists of a cloud-based analysis system for real-time detection of stroke onset, enabled by body-worn sensors and a mobile app. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients arriving in the hospital in time for IV tPA treatment and other reperfusion therapies.

Deciphering protein dynamics is a pressing challenge at the forefront of efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms of electron transfer, a fundamental process in biology. This project focuses on conformational dynamics of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), large, modular enzymes. NOSs are important because of the pivotal roles of nitric oxide production in diverse signaling processes. One hallmark of NOS is its multi-domain architecture with highly flexible tethers, allowing for dynamic, regulated interdomain electron transfer. The NOS enzyme has been extensively investigated, but due to an intrinsic complexity, involving not only dynamics, but also partner protein binding and posttranslational modification, a comprehensive picture of how it is regulated remains lacking. Quantitative insights into both the large-scale domain movements and the more localized dynamics in the docked state are necessary to provide mechanistic details. This Transitions project will enable the PI to forge a new direction in studying the docked state conformations and dynamics via site-specific 2D infrared (IR) spectroscopy. When combined with the spatial precision provided by site-selective labeling with IR probes, the approach will enable unprecedented study of the conformations and dynamics in the NOS docked states with high spatial and temporal resolution. The objective of this multidisciplinary project is to achieve residue-specific characterizations of structural dynamics of the NOS docked states and delineate their contributions to function. As NOS is a paradigm signaling system, the results will have a broad-reaching impact. The proposed approach will also provide a blueprint for studying other complex, dynamic protein systems in which its function is gated by conformational control of electron transfer between domains.

Technical abstract:    Bone is an extraordinarily complex biomaterial that fulfills biological, chemical, and mechanical roles. It provides obvious structural support but also regulates important biochemical and physiological processes including acid/base equilibrium. Dissolution of the ceramic phase of bone is essential for pH regulation via release of buffering ions like the well-studied carbonate and the mostly overlooked hydrogen phosphate. The mechanism of bone mineral dissolution, which controls the kinetics and extent of the ionic release, remains elusive due to lack of transdisciplinary vocabulary, knowledge, and technical approaches. The PI’s career vision is to integrate materials science, biology, and chemistry into a new science of skeletal & physiological systems (SaPS) to achieve a revolutionary understanding of the interplay between the physiological environment and bone composition, structure, and function. Bone mineral, a calcium apatite, is rich in hydrogen phosphate, suggesting that this ion plays a key role. The PIs research goal is to fully elucidate the relationship between skeletal composition, especially in terms of hydrogen phosphate ionic content, structure, and physiological acid/base regulation by developing a laboratory that can apply advanced transdisciplinary materials characterization tools and investigative methods. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo skeletal models will be used to examine how hydrogen phosphate affects the (1) buffering response, (2) crystal structure, and (3) functional mechanics of bone and bone mineral to unravel hydrogen phosphate--mediated dissolution and its relationship to bone structure property relations and function. Exposure of biomimetic bone apatite and individual bones to simulated body fluid with varying pHs will be employed to measure the effect of bone mineral composition on pH regulation as well as its capacity for ion exchange. These models as well as an in vivo murine model of decreased physiological pH will be examined via X-ray tomography and high-energy X-ray diffraction (XRD) to elucidate the effects of depressed physiological pH and hydrogen phosphate content on the macro-, micro-, and nano-structure of bone. Finally, mechanics of bone and bone mineral will be probed using a multi-scale approach combining XRD, digital image correlation, and whole bone bending to investigate functional changes induced by acid dissolution of bone mineral.

Ontologies and terminologies have played a vital role in biomedical research for coding, managing, sharing, and exchange of vast amounts of heterogeneous biomedical data that are being continuously generated, such as in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs have been widely used in translational research to learn predictive models for discovery and disease management across varying patient cohorts. The very first step in such EHR-based applications often concerns patient cohort identification. Cohort identification involves the specification of a collection of eligibility criterion that needs to be transformed into a computable representation using the EHR’s semantic backbone (i.e., coding systems or ontologies) before queries can run against the EHR database. However, there are two critical barriers in performing effective cohort identification from large-scale EHRs. The first one is data (or semantic) heterogeneity, caused by a mixed utilization of coding systems. The second one is the quality of the semantic backbone or ontology hierarchy, which is essential for translating patient eligibility criteria to executable database queries. To address such challenges, this project will develop new methods for ontology matching and for ontology quality enhancement that directly impact data science practice in biomedicine, such as patient cohort identification. In addition, this project will incorporate the proposed computational aspects into data science-based courses to train next generation data scientists.    This project consists of three research objectives. In Objective 1, the PI will develop new graph neural network (GNN)-based learning methods for matching biomedical ontologies by harnessing knowledge embedded in sources such as the Unified Medical Language System.

However, previous research has also shown that the nose must be large enough to take in a sufficient amount of oxygen during each breath to meet life-sustaining metabolic requirements. Accordingly, this doctoral dissertation project examines the combined effects (and possible functional trade-offs) of demands for respiratory air-conditioning and oxygen intake on the nasal complex during human evolution. By explicitly investigating climatic adaptation in nasal morphology within the context of human body size and shape, this study helps address how different anatomical systems have co-evolved in response to environmental pressures. Computed tomography (CT) scans generated for this project will be made freely available to other researchers through established online archives, substantially expanding the geographic/temporal diversity of CT scans currently available to anthropologists and the broader scientific community. This research also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and medical students (including those from under-represented groups) and the investigator will incorporate project findings into ongoing public outreach initiatives including K-12 science education programs, museum-based community engagement, public lectures, and online podcasts.    Despite substantial evidence that both climatic and metabolic pressures have likely influenced human nasal anatomy, the interplay of these two factors on nasal size and shape during human evolution is not fully understood. This study employs a ""whole-body"" approach by quantifying variation in cranial and post-cranial skeletal morphology in a large, geographically- and temporally-diverse sample of recent and fossil Homo.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenge of providing a personalized platform that performs digital motivational interviewing and adapts audiovisual content and input queries to patients’ personae. A major hurdle of applying machine learning to ACP is the variability in personal and cultural factors, as well as validation of the integrity of the responses. The project centers on the collection and analysis of psychometric data from two patient surveys combined with other health information. The project objectives are: (a) Execute a benchmark training patient survey for the machine-learning algorithm for a study on the influence of gender, ethnicity, and health status on ACP; (b) Develop a reliable persona detection tool using machine learning algorithms guided by the data, avoiding the introduction of unconscious bias; (c) Demonstrate that the platform improves completion rates and patient satisfaction compared to ACP administered by human health workers and static online platforms without machine learning; and (d) Demonstrate the alignment of the digital process with patient wishes.

However, how exactly genes and blood flow interact with one another during formation and growth of the heart remains largely unknown. This collaborative research between the University of California at Irvine (UCI) and the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) will use advanced imaging methods together with computational simulations to unravel how altered blood flow affects programmed genetic processes, and conversely how altering genetic processes changes blood flow, leading to hearts with defects. Results from this project will ultimately guide approaches to treat heart defects before a baby is born. To further broaden the impact of this project to the society, outreach activities involving rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors in California and Oregon, will engage the students in scientific activities with the goal of learning about heart development and cultivate team science skills.     Although both blood flow and genetic processes contribute to heart development, how exactly they interact and affect each other, and the synergistic roles that blood flow and genetics play to predispose the heart to malformations are yet undetermined. The project’s intellectual merit is to elucidate interlinked connections between blood flow and genetic processes during heart development. More specifically, the project will study early changes in gene expression in response to altered blood flow, and early changes in blood flow in response to altered signaling, using two complementary avian models of heart development. The project will focus on three main objectives: (1) Determine blood flow and flow-induced stresses during normal and aberrant cardiac formation through advanced engineering methods; (2) Identify and quantify cellular responses to normal and perturbed heart development by generating spatiotemporal maps of cardiac adaptation; and (3) Determine the genetic and epigenetic adaptations in cardiac tissues due to early perturbations by DNA methylation and RNA sequencing. As the broader impact, results from this project will ultimately guide fundamental knowledge on embryonic heart development and help devise strategies to improve diagnosis of heart defects, prevent heart malformations, and eventually guide early fetal interventions to ameliorate the adverse effects of cardiac defects.

Most women undergo menopause, a complex biobehavioral life stage that spans one-third of their life, frequently accompanied by a complex array of symptoms affecting their health, quality of life, relationships, and productivity. The most common and disruptive menopause symptoms are hot flashes, affecting 80% of women, and persisting for up to 10-20 years, with an average duration of 7 years. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate support for menopause symptom management, with very few physicians receiving adequate training in menopausal care and unable to provide appropriate care. Importantly, no current solution exists on the market to automatically measure hot flashes and other menopause symptoms over time, a critical limitation in tracking and managing women’s health, and supporting wellness across this challenging life stage. In the U.S., over 50 million women ages 45-55 have hot flashes. The global market for hot flashes is estimated at $9.5B annually and includes alternative, non-hormonal, and hormonal treatment options, with the U.S. accounting for about half-or $4.75B of the total global hot flash market. The proposed technology aims to solve key scientific, technical, and commercial challenges, to build the first novel cost-effective accurate wearable system for menopausal hot flash detection. The proposed wearable system will be an integrated key component of a broader mobile-based digital platform for managing menopause symptoms.    This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project  Phase I will allow the implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of using wrist-based multi-sensors, common noninvasive sensors used in commercially available wearable devices, to automatically classify hot flashes, in real-time and free-living conditions (e.g., during sleep and wake, in the presence of noise signals). A combination of synthetic and real-world data will be used to achieve the aims. The system targets >90% accuracy in hot flash classification, across different behavioral, physiological and environmental conditions, against the gold standard method (expert evaluation of fluctuation in sternum skin conductance).

This technology can solve key problems in manufacturing and logistics operations such as finding RF transmitters that are interfering with operations or monitoring the health of radio systems. These activities are required in modern industrial environments as increasing numbers of critical systems rely on radio communications to operate. In urban environments, automating the tasks of detecting, monitoring, and localizing transmitters can simplify the management of large-scale radio networks and gather critical data on wireless device usage. Increased instances of intentional jamming and the rollout of new communications standards such as 5G make these tasks critical to the modern city. Traditionally, such monitoring tasks are conducted manually with expensive spectrum monitoring equipment. Automated installations also utilize expensive sensors, making automated spectrum monitoring only feasible in safety-critical areas such as around airports. Lower-cost sensors can be installed permanently at a high density for almost any application, allowing cities and smaller industrial customers to deploy persistent monitoring networks.    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to deploy high-density networks of low-cost sensors, determine the efficacy of existing detection and localization algorithms as applied to the network, and evaluate novel machine-learning (ML) algorithms for similar tasks. This project will also mitigate the technical risk of deploying such a system by characterizing how well commodity software-defined radio (SDR) hardware can perform across a variety of operational environments. No high-density and large-scale test networks of inexpensive radio hardware have been deployed for the purposes of industrial and urban spectrum monitoring, so data gathered throughout this SBIR Phase I project will be useful in evaluating the viability of this approach. By evaluating ML algorithms for signal detection and localization, this project can help determine how effective machine learning models can be at ingesting RF data from low-cost sensors and synthesizing actionable outputs about the radio environment.

Providing early STEM interest pathways for these populations that are historically underrepresented in STEM fields is critical to creating gender equity in the STEM workforce. There are profound inequities in STEM fields for women of color that impact their interest and persistence in these fields. This Research in Service to Practice project will build important knowledge about early pathways for reducing these inequities by developing early interest in STEM. Gender stereotypes around who can do STEM are one of the sociocultural barriers that contributes to girls’ loss of interest in STEM. These stereotypes emerge early and steer young women away from STEM studies and pursuits. Exposing girls to role models is an effective strategy for challenging stereotypes of who belongs and succeeds in STEM. This project will explore how an afterschool program that combines narrative and storytelling approaches, STEM role models, and family supports, sparks elementary-age girls’ interest in STEM and fosters their STEM identity. The project targets K-5 students and families from underrepresented groups (e.g., Latinx and African American) living in poverty. The project will evaluate an inquiry-based, afterschool program that serves both elementary school girls and boys and explores if adding storytelling components to the out-of-school time (OST) learning will better support girls’ interest in STEM. The storytelling features include: 1) shared reading of books featuring females in STEM; 2) students’ own narratives that reminisce about their STEM experiences; and 3) video interviews of female parents and community members with STEM careers. A secondary aim of this project is to build capacity of schools and afterschool providers to deliver and sustain afterschool STEM enrichment experiences. Museum-based informal STEM experts will co-teach with afterschool providers to deliver the Children’s Museum Houston (CMH) curriculum called Afterschool Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (A’STEAM). Although A’STEAM has been implemented in over 100 sites and shows promise, to scale-up this and other promising afterschool programs, the team will evaluate how professional development resources and the co-facilitation approach can build afterschool educators' capacity to deliver the most promising approaches.    Researchers at the Children’s Learning Institute (CLI) at UTHealth will partner with Museum-based informal STEM educators at CMH, YES Prep, a high performing charter school serving >95% of underrepresented groups, and other afterschool providers serving mostly underrepresented groups experiencing poverty. Storytelling components that highlight females in STEM will be added to an existing afterschool program (A'STEAM Basic).  This derivative program is called A’STEAM Stories. Both instantiations of the afterschool programs (Basic and Stories) include an afterschool educator component (ongoing professional development and coaching), a family component (e.g., home extension activities, in-person, and virtual family learning events), and two age-based groups (K-G2 and G3-G5). Further, the A’STEAM Stories professional development for educators includes training that challenges STEM gender stereotypes and explains how to make science interesting to girls. The 4-year project has four phases. In Phase 1, researchers, CMH, and afterschool educators will adapt the curriculum for scalability and the planned storytelling variation. During Phase 2, the research team will conduct an experimental study to evaluate program impacts on increasing STEM interest and identity and reducing STEM gender stereotypes. To this end, the project’s team will recruit 36 sites and 1200 children across Kindergarten through Grade 5. This experimental phase is designed to produce causal evidence and meet the highest standards for rigorous research. The researchers will randomly assign sites to one of three groups: control, A’STEAM Basic, or A’STEAM Stories. During Phase 3, researchers will follow-up with participating sites to understand if the inclusion of afterschool educators as co-facilitators of the program allowed for sustainability after Museum informal science educator support is withdrawn. In Phase 4, the team will disseminate the afterschool curriculum and conduct two training-of-trainers for local and national afterschool educators. This study uses quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data sources include educator and family surveys, focus groups, and interviews as well as observations of afterschool program instructional quality and analysis of parent-child discourse during a STEM task. Constructs assessed with children include STEM interest, STEM identity, and STEM gender stereotype endorsement as well as standardized measures of vocabulary, science, and math. Findings will increase understanding of how to optimize OST STEM experiences for elementary-age girls and how to strengthen STEM interest for all participants. Further, this project will advance our knowledge of the extent to which scaffolded, co-teaching approaches build capacity of afterschool providers to sustain inquiry-based STEM programs.    This Research in Service to Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to (a) advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments; (b) provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences; (c) advance innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments; and (d) engage the public of all ages in learning STEM in informal environments.

At the same time, computer users are tackling new problems with massive datasets that must be manipulated in irregular and rapidly changing ways while maintaining strict privacy guarantees. Efficiently supporting big, sparse, dynamic, and private data to solve large complex problems on heterogeneous systems is one of the grand challenges in software/hardware systems research. To address this grand challenge, the Panorama project is exploring integrated rack-scale acceleration for computational pangenomics. Integrated rack-scale acceleration refers to an emerging computer-systems paradigm that uses tens of tightly integrated computing nodes, each of which includes a mix of general-purpose processors and specialized accelerators interconnected with a special-purpose network. Computational pangenomics refers to a recent trend towards representing genomes, the genetic material of an organism, not as a single linear sequence of DNA base pairs but instead as an intricate network of sequences that efficiently represents the relationships between many individuals' genomes at once. Computational pangenomics naturally captures the trend towards big, sparse, dynamic, and private data and is thus a perfect application domain to explore heterogeneous software/hardware systems research. The project's novelties are: a truly cross-stack approach spanning applications, programming languages, compilers, architecture, security, and privacy including use of a one-of-a-kind Panorama prototype system; new hardware techniques to accelerate domain-specific computing and to unify heterogeneous systems; new software techniques to let programmers harness the performance advantages of heterogeneous systems; and new software/hardware techniques to make such heterogeneous systems more secure. The project's impacts are: to specifically enable computational biologists to better see the ""genetic dark matter"" of population-wide genomics which has been to date hidden, opening up new scientific discoveries; and to more generally enable future computer users to more easily take advantage of heterogeneous computer systems to solve large and complex problems. This project is also pursuing two broader impact initiatives. The first is an ambitious yet concrete initiative to increase participation of under-represented minority students in computer science by developing a low-level computer-systems module for a new four-week summer program targeting rising sophomores. The second involves specific plans to grow the open-source software/hardware ecosystem in the computational-biology and computer-systems communities.    The Panorama project includes a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers across four focus areas: applications (computational biology), programming languages & compilers, computer architecture, and security & privacy. The team is taking a holistic software/hardware co-design approach to explore five tightly interconnected research thrusts. The first three thrusts are structured from top-down across the computing stack. Thrust 1 investigates new computational pangenomics data structures and algorithms and will develop PanoBench, a new benchmark suite suitable for driving the remaining thrusts. Thrust 2 investigates new programming-language and compiler techniques. Thrust 3 investigates new computer architectures with support for a whole-rack manycore with 1M+ cores and a partitioned global address space, unified array-based accelerators, and application-specific accelerator chiplets for computational pangenomics. The final two thrusts cut across both software and hardware. Thrust 4 investigates new security and privacy techniques including scalable secure computation on heterogeneous rack-scale systems, secure rack-scale resource management with auto-tuning, and differential privacy and homomorphic encryption for pangenomics. Thrust 5 involves holistically evaluating the research ideas in the other thrusts through the use of a one-of-a-kind Panorama prototype system.

Molecular machines have received intensive scientific scrutiny because of their importance in cell biology, but their complex functions have been difficult to characterize in a quantitative way.  This project will use cutting-edge computational and data-analysis methods to make key strides toward quantification.  The computational analysis will also be used to design further experiments to refine knowledge of these critical systems.  Educational efforts that will supplement the research include developing an online quantitative biophysics course, developing several other online educational resources, and conducting an outreach program with high school students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.    In further detail, the research project will pursue what can be termed a systems biology approach to molecular machines, attempting to investigate a large set of mechanistic possibilities using advanced computations.

It can cluster patients into subgroups and capture the interactions between multiple attributes (e.g., specific procedures used to treat a disease), enabling precision medicine. Effective phenotyping needs to be supported by a large number of diverse samples to avoid potential population bias. A major challenge is how to derive phenotypes jointly across multiple institutions, while preserving individual patients' privacy at each site. The goal of this project is to develop a federated tensor factorization framework for Privacy-preserving, Robust, and Efficient computational phenotyping using Multisite EHR Data (PREMED). While many techniques have been developed for federated learning for each of these goals, their synergy has not been well studied. Communication-efficient techniques such as compression have an intrinsic benefit to privacy (smaller disclosure risks) and robustness (smaller adversarial impact) due to the compressed and obfuscated communication. Further, federated tensor factorization presents unique challenges due to its multi-factor structure and unsupervised nature. The project aims to exploit the synergy between efficiency, privacy, and robustness and address the three interrelated challenges with a holistic approach, while utilizing the multi-factor structure of tensor factorization. The research outcome will allow institutions to jointly perform computational phenotyping using their privacy-protected data effectively and efficiently.

PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women and leads to higher risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, infertility, and cancer. Women with PCOS are using on average 5 to 6 separate apps to manage their symptoms. Many of these apps are not based upon research. Women with PCOS note frustration, confusion and exhaustion trying to determine the right diet and the right way to manage their health problems. Many do not have access to a specialist or even a local health care provider with knowledge of PCOS. The goal is to educate women with PCOS about their unique nutritional and metabolic needs and to offer “one place” for women with PCOS to go for evidence-based advice from experts in this field.    This I-Corps project is based on the development of a web-based application for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  Research has shown that PCOS patients may control and mitigate their symptoms by managing their diet. The unique feature of this diet is that it is not based on counting caloric intakes, rather it is based on eliminating certain elements from the diet. The technology is based on a prospective clinical trial leading to an average weight loss of 19 pounds in 8 weeks without counting calories, carbs or fats. In addition, participants showed a 50% reduction in fasting insulin and a significant reduction in total testosterone as well.

These ulcers affect one-fourth of patients with diabetes over their lifetimes, significantly impacting mobility and life expectancy. When treatment for an ulcer is too late, the only option is often amputation; in fact, diabetic foot ulcers account for the majority of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. Reducing the incidence of severe ulcers will improve the health and welfare of the American public as well as mitigate the economic burden of diabetes on the American healthcare system. By some estimates, treatment for diabetic foot ulcers accounts for one-third of all direct diabetic healthcare spending. Therefore, preventing these ulcers would save the US healthcare system tens of billions of dollars per year. The proposed solution will monitor foot ulcers consistently to prevent further damage.    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a computer vision system for detecting and monitoring diabetic foot ulcers with an imaging device. The current standard of care is for patients to inspect their own feet visually every day, but these inspections happen inconsistently and unreliably. If successful, this system will automatically identify patients’ feet consistently across several days and lighting conditions. It will classify late-stage wounds, allowing physicians to monitor progression or healing of ulcers. Further, it will estimate the risk of future ulcers, enabling early-stage intervention.

The work will lead to new treatments to improve nationwide health. One way to study how diseases affect women and men differently is to include people with Turner Syndrome. Like men, people with Turner Syndrome have only one X chromosome, but they are born with female features. The goal of this research is to identify X chromosome genes that regulate how heart valve cells respond to forces. This force response affects the development of the bicuspid aortic valve, and can create a birth defect. This problem is more common in men than in women, but is 50 times more common in people with Turner Syndrome. People with a bicuspid aortic valve and Turner Syndrome often need to have their aortic valves replaced at a relatively young age. Unfortunately, it is very hard to detect bicuspid aortic valve disease, even with imaging. This research will lead to new treatments for patients who need surgical valve replacement. A broad range of cardiovascular disease patients will benefit from these results, not only those with Turner Syndrome. This project will involve a collaboration between biomedical engineers, geneticists, and cardiologists. The research team will educate the Turner Syndrome community about bioengineering and the research. By training graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, this project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research. It will also advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning.    X chromosome dosage is a novel regulatory factor for endothelial to mesenchymal transformation. Understanding this novel aspect of cell mechanobiology will be broadly relevant to sexually dimorphic development and disease.  This research will address how regulation of endothelial to mesenchymal transformation is involved in bicuspid aortic valve development and fibrocalcific changes of bicuspid valves in adults. Using cells from Turner Syndrome patients, the research team will quantify a role for X chromosome dosage in mechanical regulation of this transformation by controlling the microenvironment, exogenous mechanical stimuli, and patient-specific characteristics. Finally, inducible transgenic approaches will be used to correct X chromosome gene expression and reverse the transformation defects. This data will provide transformational new information on the role of X chromosome genes and their mechanobiology in bicuspid aortic valves and identify new therapeutic targets for related diseases that affect millions of patients.

Despite growing knowledge about Legionella aerosolization and inhalation in residential, commercial, and institutional buildings and in healthcare facilities, disease outbreaks are increasing. Since the first Legionella outbreak in 1976, numerous bench, pilot, and field-scale studies have been conducted to develop strategies and guidelines for the mitigation and prevention of disease outbreaks. However, the development of a quantitative framework to predict Legionella disease outbreak in buildings has remained elusive. The overarching goal of this multi-institution collaborative project is to advance the fundamental understanding of Legionella growth in building water systems and leverage this new knowledge to develop and validate a computational model to predict potential hotspots of Legionella growth and exposure in buildings. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the development of new fundamental knowledge and modeling tools to identify the design/operational parameters and environmental conditions of a building’s premise plumbing system that most affect the growth and persistence of Legionella. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students and an undergraduate student at Arizona State University, the New York State Department of Health, and the College of New Jersey.     Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is an infectious pathogen of increasing concern due to its ability to cause Legionnaires’ Disease (LD), a severe pneumonia, and the difficulty in controlling the bacteria’s persistence in drinking water systems. L. pneumophila thrives within large premise plumbing systems such as those found in hospitals. Commonly used disinfectants are not effective in eradicating L. pneumophila from premise plumbing systems. In addition, there is no validated model to predict the concentration of viable Legionella cells in a building water system. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate a computational model that could predict the growth and persistence of L. pneumophila within a building’s premise plumbing as a function of system design, operational parameters, and environmental conditions. The specific objectives of the research are to: (1) Use state-of-the-art, rapid sampling techniques to quantify Legionella concentrations, water quality parameters, operational parameters, and building design specifications in data-rich buildings with known Legionella problems and/or disease cases where the New York State Department of Health has ongoing partnerships; (2) Derive Legionella kinetic information over a multivariate parameter space using targeted and multifactorial experiments with a combination of parameters including biofilm conditions, disinfectant residual concentrations, temperatures, and nutrient loadings; and (3) Develop and validate a computational model (with site-specific information and updated kinetic information) to predict Legionella persistence and growth in premise plumbing systems that will inform quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models of LD outbreaks in buildings. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the development of new fundamental knowledge and modeling tools to support more accurate estimates of human health risks associated with LD outbreaks in buildings.

Some of these changes have economic and health implications, as stress responses have been linked to the formation of stress-resistant biofilms, virulence, antibiotic tolerance/resistance and persistence. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the Vibrio cholerae SipA pathway, with an emphasis on understanding how the pathway helps this pathogen and other bacteria survive in the presence of stressors such as antimicrobial peptides. This project will support the training of a Ph.D. student who is interested in science education. In addition, science education graduate students, high school science teachers and high school science classes will participate in the project.    Vibrio species must detect and respond appropriately to stresses they encounter to survive in the diverse environments they inhabit.  SipA is a highly conserved stress-responsive protein that plays a major role in V. cholerae survival in the presence of several stress-inducing agents. Dedicated regulators of sipA expression and protein interaction partners have been identified, but little else is known about this essential stress response mechanism. Due to the conservation of SipA, it may be a key stress response protein in numerous bacteria. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are to fully characterize the regulation of this stress response system, establish the mechanism(s) by which SipA contributes to stress survival, and determine how this system is integrated with other biological processes in V. cholerae.  Other stress response mechanisms in environmental Vibrios of ecological importance will also be characterized as a part of the educational goals of this proposal. There are likely to be significant differences among these genetically diverse environmental species and this work will distinguish between broadly-conserved and species-specific survival mechanisms.

The first target application is hydrocephalus, a life-long, incurable disease characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain’s ventricles. Hydrocephalus is treatable by chronically implanting a shunt to divert CSF from the brain into the abdominal cavity. Around 90,000 shunts are implanted in the US each year. However, these shunts fail at alarming rates (40% within the 1st year of use), leading first to nonspecific symptoms such as headaches and blurred vision and then to permanent brain damage and death without clinical intervention. Diagnosing shunt failure is difficult and involves a prolonged assessment period with costly imaging studies and invasive shunt taps. The proposed sensor module can be integrated with already-commercialized shunt systems and may allow remote, on-demand measurement of shunt status, therapeutic efficacy, and patient health, ultimately improving clinical outcomes while reducing overall treatment costs.    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the integration of various microsensors to generate a diagnostic data set for data analytics. This data set will significantly advance the scientific/medical understanding of hydrocephalus, which is limited today by the paucity of data on CSF dynamics over time. The system would include several first-to-market capabilities, including chronic repeated measurement of CSF dynamics and automated wireless transduction from multiple sensors to a cloud-based database for analyses and dissemination. The smart shunt system will enable remote, on-demand monitoring of shunt status, giving physicians the data necessary for timely diagnosis and prediction of shunt failure. At-home electronic shunt monitoring will allow physicians to quantitatively and proactively manage patients’ disease in real-time, and thereby improve their quality of life.

Songbirds, like the zebra finch, are excellent species for understanding how the brain controls fine motor skills involved in song production because the juvenile songbird learns to sing its species songs by imitating an adult of its species. The brain circuits involved in this imitative learning have been studied for many decades and are now well described. The project is aimed at understanding the electrical properties within these well-studied brain regions by focusing on the cells in these areas and how ions move in and out of channels in these cells to produce electrical properties.  The goal of these studies is to measure precise electrical activity of these cells and to modify genes in these cells that may influence electrical properties thereby possibly affecting motor patterns during song production. These studies will expose undergraduate and high school students to cutting edge molecular and cellular neuroscience. The results of our work will be available through publications, presentations at scientific conferences, science fairs and Brain Awareness events.     We propose to study how intrinsic excitable properties of neurons are modulated within the brain circuitry that subserves a complex learned behavior. We will use zebra finches, a songbird species with a well characterized vocal circuitry, and focus on nucleus RA (robustus arcopallialis), a motor cortical area analogous to upper cortical vocal motor neurons in mammals. We have recently found that high-threshold voltage gated potassium channels (Kv3.1) are differentially expressed in RA and undergo marked developmental “switches” in expression, in concert with marked age differences in the excitable properties of RA neurons. We hypothesize that these molecular and cellular changes play key roles in shaping RA’s excitability properties and establishing features of adult RA (e.g. high firing rates and fidelity) that are important for the emerging bioacoustic features of song during the critical period for vocal acquisition. We will test these hypotheses using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in brain slices, in situ hybridization, and song bioacoustics analysis, as well as viral-based manipulations and dynamic clamp modeling to mechanistically test the role of specific key ion channel subunits in modulating the remarkably narrow action potentials of RA projection neurons.

The specific focus is on prior authorization processing, where payers and prescribers must reach a consensus on medical necessity. The project delivers a solution to optimize prescription authorization and provide more comprehensive patient histories for clinical authorization criteria fulfillment than other available products on the current health technology market. Lack of efficient access to reliable patient histories is the principal reason for delayed authorizations, resulting in delayed care access. A 2022 survey showed 93% of physicians reported that prior authorization often or always creates care delays; 82% reported delays that led to treatment abandonment. A secure yet progressively decentralized patient data transfer protocol would heighten transparency of clinical decision-making processes and also increase opportunities for patient engagement during prior authorization of medical prescriptions. Further, since administrative costs increase the cost of benefits, which in turn increases the cost of care access, the potential commercial impact is that payers who lower administrative costs will be better positioned to offer higher reimbursement rates for a greater range of quality treatment options, at increasingly lower cost.    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to deliver a distributed ledger with smart contracts specific to the domain of pharmaceutical benefits. Since the cause of processing inefficiency lies with siloed and incomplete patient histories, this protocol resolves administrative inefficiencies through distributed ledger technology supporting fast and compliant encrypted health data sharing among prescribers, payers, and patients. Research objectives include: 1) automating criteria fulfillment to reduce administrative waste; 2) leveraging machine learning to automate simpler case reviews; and 3) designing a shared interorganizational processing protocol capable of adapting to an introduction of revised clinical standards. Smart contracts will be deployed to a distributed ledger infrastructure to formalize and enforce clinical standards as well as contractually specified financial rules and actuarial analyses at an interorganizational level. With smart contracts embedded in the authorization process to automatically curate more robust clinical histories over each prescription lifecycle, available real world data meeting contractually specified quality standards for clinical review will increase. Historical authorization data will feed back into incrementally complex cases, advancing artificial intelligence for authorization decision support.

The extraordinary preservation of primate and sloth fossils from the Mid-Miocene Santa Cruz Formation allows investigation of diet, body size, locomotor patterns, and community ecology before and after a peak in global temperature. Today, these groups in South America are primarily herbivorous and wholly tree-dwelling; they are also vulnerable to habitat destruction and shifts in weather patterns because they depend on warm, wet forests. Understanding how these groups adapted to major climatic shifts in the past will advance scientific knowledge about the effects of ecological change on vulnerable mammalian groups more generally. The project also will foster international collaborations and support graduate student training, public science outreach, and K-12 science outreach including the development of teaching kits.     This project will focus on primates and sloths living before and after a major spike in global temperature (Mid Miocene Climatic Optimum). Previously, most of the work on the Santa Cruz Formation of Argentina has focused on the rich field sites of the (older) Lower Member of the formation.

These include effective methods for data analysis and prediction in important areas of application ranging from privacy protection via differential privacy (DP) to precision medicine and public health disparities focusing on the prediction of epigenetic markers, and to predictions with employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This project aims to develop and employ new methods known as mixed model prediction. Particularly, for the DP application, the investigators will apply the methods to the publicly released 2020 U.S. decennial census; for the BLS application the investigators will target questions regarding volatility during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that thus require robust modifications from traditional approaches. The research will be carried out in conjunction with collaborators who are immersed in a particular application area.    In this project, the investigators will focus on three major aims: 1) multivariate mixed model prediction (MMP) in genomic prediction problems where correlated DNA methylation markers reflect underlying disease biology and improved prediction accuracy is possible by borrowing strength across this multivariate structure; 2) MMP for differentially private (DP) data in which cluster or grouping identities are contaminated by design and not released to protect privacy; and 3) MMP with non-Gaussian random effects and errors, which greatly can expand the range of circumstances in which MMP can be applied beyond the classical normality assumptions that do not fit many modern datasets. The investigators will develop the required methodology for each aim, study the procedures theoretically, and carry out extensive empirical simulation studies to compare the new methods with other methods.

This project will develop wearable continuous glucose biosensor platforms to address a broad set of disease and wellness applications, such as measuring additional molecules relevant to diabetes management, improving management of cardiovascular diseases, and therapeutic drug monitoring to customize dosages.  In addition to impacting human health (particularly for chronic diseases) in the United States, the commercial market is significant and valued at approximately $120 B/year.

Quantification of cancer evolutionary dynamics is therefore essential to understanding the mechanisms of cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing has enabled characterization of tumor composition at the finest possible resolution, thus providing researchers with the data needed to potentially allow for such quantification. However, to realize this potential, appropriate algorithms and data analysis tools are needed. The computational discipline that extracts evolutionary parameters from genomic data by integrating phylogenetics, population genetics and statistical learning is called phylodynamics. While almost all existing phylodynamics methods are developed for viruses, there is a growing realization that this methodology is also highly relevant to cancer biology. However, the development of cancer phylodynamics algorithms faces many challenges associated with the nature of cancer genomics data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing a phylodynamic framework for joint inference of cancer phylogenetic trees and evolutionary parameters from single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-Seq) data. This framework will allow cancer researchers to carry out a statistically and computationally sound evaluation of the effects of particular genome alterations or their combinations. In addition, this project will support development of innovative cross-disciplinary curricula, and bioinformatics training for diverse cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia State University (Title III designation of Predominantly Black Institution), University of Connecticut, and UConn Health.      The project has three interrelated technical aims. First, investigators will develop algorithms for joint reconstruction of clonal frequencies and phased cancer clone genomic profiles (including copy number variation profiles and single nucleotide variants). The project will concentrate on low-coverage scDNA-seq that can  provide enough clonal data to guarantee the density of branching events in the cancer  phylogenies necessary for phylodynamics analysis. Second, the researchers will design a novel methodology for intra-tumor phylodynamics inference. This includes scalable construction of plausible clone phylogenetic trees  using a novel bipartition-based median-tree approach, together with maximum a posteriori inference of cancer fitness and mutability landscapes. The distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is the use of convex optimization techniques rather than MCMC sampling, which will guarantee scalability and accuracy of developed computational tools. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments will be conducted to validate and assess the accuracy of developed methods.  These will include computational experiments on simulated and publicly available scDNA-Seq data, as well as using scDNA-Seq datasets generated by in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted at UConn Health.

Navigating through the human blood stream is no small feat either. To efficiently deliver drugs through blood circulation to reach deep-seated disease sites is one of the most critical challenges in treating cancer, the second largest cause of fatality in US and globally. Although significant strides have been made on developing various nanocarriers to help with that, efficacious patient responses remain modest compared to conventional drug formulations. The somewhat less stellar performance of nanocarriers is attributed to their poor transport inside the body. To address the deficiency, this project aims to develop a new family of nanocarrier called polymer nanodiscs that mimic the high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles (HDL) in human blood. The nascent form of HDL is well-known lipid nanodisc that mediates highly efficient cholesterol transport from peripheral cells back to the liver. Intriguingly, disc-shaped particles have been shown to outperform spherical ones with prolonged blood circulation half-lives and higher cellular internalization rates. Most nanocarriers under development are spherical in shape because it is technically challenging to prepare disc-shaped nanoparticles through chemical synthesis. This project will elucidate the design principles of biocompatible block copolymers that self-assemble with membrane-scaffold proteins (or membrane-scaffold polymers) into well-defined polymer nanodiscs to carry tumor-specific targeting and drug release moieties. If successful, it may bring forth another advance in harnessing nanotechnology for cancer diagnostics and treatment. The design concepts may have broad impact in other related fields, such as nanodisc-based immunotherapy, nanodisc-based structural and functional studies of membrane proteins, and the development of biomimetic 2-dimensional materials for applications in human health, clean energy, and environment. Through the integrated education and outreach activities, this project will help motivate graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students to pursue career paths in the interdisciplinary area of materials science, nanoengineering, and biomedical science.    Technical description  Nanotechnology has been widely anticipated to benefit the diagnostic and treatment of cancers. Despite the significant strides in nanocarrier development, efficacious patient responses remain modest compared to conventional drug formulations. Clearly, a gap of knowledge exists on nanocarrier design beyond simply controlling their sizes. The lipoprotein-mimicking nanodiscs represent a novel family of 2-dimensional materials with great potential for drug delivery, as mounting evidence has suggested that disc-shaped particles outperform spherical ones with prolonged blood circulation half-lives and higher cellular uptake. Adapting lipid nanodiscs (LNDs) for anticancer drug delivery has attracted lots of attention, but as drug carriers LNDs suffer from low stability, short shelf life, limited drug loading capacity, and difficulty for chemical modifications. The objective of this project is to elucidate the self-assembly principle between amphiphilic block and random copolymers toward the formation of novel lipoprotein-mimicking polymer nanodiscs (PNDs) with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, long-term stability, high drug loading capacity, and facile modification chemistry for anticancer drug delivery. Synthetic strategies to prepare well-defined amphiphilic block copolymers that carry tumor-specific targeting and drug release moieties will be developed, and the self-assembly behavior between model block copolymers and membrane-scaffold proteins (MSPs) into PNDs will be elucidated. De novo designed synthetic membrane-scaffold polymers (MSPols) that potentially overcome the limitations of biologically-derived MSPs will also be explored to develop fully synthetic PNDs for anticancer drug delivery. PNDs are expected to break the limitations of LNDs without compromising their highly sought-after size and shape that favor prolonged circulation half-lives and enhanced cellular uptake, hence potentially bringing forth another advance in harnessing nanotechnology for cancer treatment. Besides anticancer drug delivery, this study will also fill a critical gap of knowledge on the rational design of synthetic biodegradable MSPols that rival MSPs in encasing nanodiscs.

When the remains belong to an unidentified decedent, the first step is to construct a “biological profile,” in which the estimation of sex is a crucial component. Accuracy in sex estimation increases when both metric (e.g., the length of a bone) and morphological (e.g., the shape of a bone) data are used and when multiple skeletal elements are assessed. There are currently no methods for sex estimation that meet both of these criteria. Forensic anthropologists are often called upon to testify in legal proceedings and provide expert evidence; however, the field of forensic anthropology lacks an assessment of how sex estimation methods have been evaluated when the admissibility of such evidence is challenged, resulting in little guidance on which methods forensic anthropologists should use and how to develop improved methods. There are currently 13,885 individuals listed as “unidentified” in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, including 796 individuals for whom sex is listed as “unsure.” This research will produce a new method for sex estimation that meets legal admissibility standards and additionally can accommodate the wide range of remains that are recovered (e.g., only a skull versus a complete skeleton), with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of unidentified bodies in the United States.    This project will combine metric and morphological data from multiple skeletal elements into a single prediction model that will satisfy key legal considerations during evidentiary challenges, while improving accuracy and reliability. A framework for method development will be created that incorporates (1) legal perspectives on the admissibility of expert witness evidence and (2) forensic anthropology perspectives on methods of sex estimation to reduce barriers for adopting a new method. Using this framework, skeletal data will be collected and integrated into a prediction model, using the novel Mixed Cumulative Probit algorithm, and will be disseminated as a free, open-access web-based graphical user interface available to all forensic anthropologists. This innovative approach will result in a single, statistically valid sex estimation method that can accommodate both continuous and ordinal data, conditional dependence, heteroskedasticity, and missing data and therefore be used in the vast majority of forensic anthropology casework. By using legal admissibility criteria as guidelines, the resulting model will also be robust to evidentiary challenges.

The knowledge will gain insights into the potential molecular mechanism related to cell evolution, tissue development, disease progression, and drug resistance. The developed tools will significantly improve our understanding of tissue heterogeneity and development. The characterization and use of subclones and spatial architecture for function analysis will provide a completely different approach to study tissue heterogeneity. Graduate and undergraduate students will work under this project and gain experience in leading-edge research. An undergraduate summer research program on ""Computational Systems Biology” will be organized.       Systematic analysis methods used to analyze spatial transcriptome data are still in their infancy. Current analysis methods of spatial transcriptome data focus on transcriptional profiling. Novel methods are needed to identify genomic variants and integrate genetic and transcriptional variations. To address the challenges, a hybrid model based on Variational Graph AutoEncoder (VGAE) will be developed to characterize the spatial relationship between the spots and subclones. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) will be used to infer the copy number variations (CNVs) from spatial transcriptomic data.

As uncontrolled bleeding remains the leading cause of preventable death from trauma, effective hemorrhage-control training may be the difference between life and death for a trauma victim. Though existing training programs have been successful in reaching large groups of people across the globe, these training programs are limited by the use of unrealistic training models. The proposed technology, while remaining portable and affordable, is designed to realistically simulate a hemorrhagic emergency. For institutions who educate the public, their students, or their employees on hemorrhage-control techniques, this technology may offer better training without increasing training time. As interest and mandates surrounding widespread hemorrhage-control training beyond the healthcare setting continue to expand at the local, state, and national levels, it is imperative that trainees are provided with a realistic training experience to ensure that they are prepared to act in a real-life hemorrhagic emergency.    This I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, affordable, and realistic hemorrhage-control training device that utilizes real-time biofeedback mechanisms to model a physiological response to application of proper hemorrhage-control techniques. Though hemorrhage-control training models exist, they are not feasible for use in widespread training due to high costs. Research suggests not only that current training programs lack realistic simulation, but that this shortcoming may compromise the effectiveness of these programs on preparing individuals to perform life-saving skills in a real-life trauma situation. The most commonly reported elements of hemorrhage-control training programs that lack realism include demonstration of bleeding, the actual pressure needed to stop a bleed, the stress and urgency of a real-life emergency, and the reaction of a wounded patient to intervention. To address these shortcomings, the proposed technology may include a traumatic wound with pressure sensors that read pressure applied directly to the wound as well as through application of a tourniquet. Upon application of adequate pressure, hemorrhage cessation will be demonstrated. Additionally, a speaker will be embedded to simulate a patient’s reaction.

The modern human craniofacial complex has evolved to become smaller, with shorter midface and globular brain shape, characteristics linked to changes in diet and chewing. Previous investigations of this topic using bone in comparative and fossil materials have methodological limitations. Here, a novel combination of state-of-the-art imaging methods is used to analyze changes in bone and soft tissues during craniofacial development. The research has the potential to inform public health research on early life development. The project fosters student training and mentoring in STEM, and resulting data are disseminated through publications, presentations, and publicly available imaging databases.     The project uses a gracilized comparative model to examine the influence of early and typical weaning on musculoskeletal craniofacial development. The specific aims of this project are to characterize the effects of (1) craniofacial gracilization and (2) early weaning on musculoskeletal performance, integration, and symmetry during the stages of oral motor skill development in early life. Previous research has focused on changes in skeletal tissue, primarily due to limitations in what is visible in a standard CT and what is preserved in the fossil record. A novel combination of contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) methods is used in this project to analyze ontogenetic series of bone, muscle, and cartilage. This multilevel research design incorporates evolutionary, behavioral, morphological, and functional theories, allowing greater understanding of the impact of function and tissue interactions on the musculoskeletal development in the craniofacial complex. Furthermore, this project can improve our understanding of the form-function interrelationships in the craniofacial complex during highly plastic early life stages, with implications for behavioral adaptations and growth trajectories during human evolution.

Epithelia also organize with even higher complexity to form glands, like the pancreas, sweat glands, and salivary glands. Glandular epithelia rely on a soft, layered extracellular matrix with a directional organization to polarize these cells and enable their secretory function. If damaged by severe injury or disease, delicate branched tissues like the salivary gland often respond with a repair (rather than regenerative) response, yielding a permanently dysfunctional, disorganized array of scar tissue. The resulting loss of salivary function can have dramatic impacts on oral health and quality of life. Researchers continue to search for ways to regenerate these scarred tissues, and three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is one method that could have potential application to this need. The research activities of this CAREER award will focus on applying a new method of bioprinting to epithelial regeneration, with the intent of delivering more precise deposition of cells, within supportive hydrogels, in 3D. In the educational and outreach activities, multidisciplinary teams of dental students, graduate students, and undergraduates will partner together to implement unique, low-cost bioprinters toward these same problems. Larger groups of students will be introduced to Houston’s growing culture of entrepreneurship and innovation, gaining creative inspiration for their future careers. The program’s goal is to recruit, train, and retain students with diverse backgrounds, to advance a future cadre of multidisciplinary scientists in oral health.      The investigator’s laboratory designs, synthesizes, and characterizes polymeric and supramolecular biomaterials for clinical use, across applications in tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and preclinical drug screening. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to leverage recent advances in biomaterials and coaxial microfluidic bioprinting to print ultrathin hydrogel layers, with controlled gradients in biochemical composition and mechanical properties, that drive cellular organization and phenotype display of co-encapsulated epithelia and surrounding mesenchyme. The specific research objectives are to: (1) tailor hydrogel composition to support concentric epithelial/mesenchymal cell interaction, (2) quantify epithelial cell migration and organization behavior within bioprinted hydrogel structures of varying dimension, composition, porosity, and cellular partners, and (3) assess differentiation and organization as a function of these same print parameters. In tandem, the integrated education goal of this project is to develop a cohort of experts at the interface of oral biology and biomaterials, across multiple education levels, within a dental school setting. Specific education objectives are to: (1) implement interdisciplinary bioprinting education for dental students, graduate students in biosciences, and undergraduates in bioengineering within a summer research program, (2) increase engagement for students from historically underrepresented or excluded backgrounds, and (3) leverage Houston’s startup ecosystem to expose students to STEM translation and entrepreneurship, alongside didactic training in methods of innovation.

Some medical conditions are not easy to diagnose because symptoms are ambiguous or easy to confuse with other conditions, which contributes to diagnostic errors. This is especially the case for rare diseases with which physicians may not have much experience. This project examines whether marginalized status (e.g., racially and ethnically minoritized people and women) and the structure of patient-physician network ties are associated with delays in diagnosis of medical conditions with ambiguous symptoms. The findings from this project can lead to better healthcare interventions that could reduce health disparities related to diagnostic errors.    This project determines the social and structural predictors of delays in diagnosis of medical conditions with ambiguous symptoms. Drawing on theories from social psychology, this study hypothesizes that marginalized people are more likely to experience longer delays in diagnosis of diseases with ambiguous symptoms because the diagnostic process can be affected by racial, gender, and other stereotypes. Drawing on theories from network science, this study hypothesizes that patient-physician network structures that encourage exposure to non-redundant information (new possible diagnoses or tests to consider), together with physicians’ increased willingness to accept mistakes and correct misdiagnoses are associated with faster times to diagnoses of medical conditions with ambiguous symptoms. The project combines Longitudinal Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) medical claims data with the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile data to quantitatively test these hypotheses. Patient-physician networks are constructed through direct links between patients and physicians based on clinical encounters and indirect links between physicians through the patients they share. This project is important for understanding how social networks influence the patient-physician relationship and diagnostic processes, and for reducing the number of diagnostic errors in the U.S. healthcare system.

An estimated 250,000 dogs get B cell lymphoma every year. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy offers hope for a treatment for this disease. The project platform for engineering CAR-T cell therapy at scale enables the generation of a potential new therapeutic product that is affordable on the veterinary market. The potential societal and commercial impacts of the project have the potential to translate successful therapies from dogs into human cancer care.  This solution also offers a new model for the testing, development, and translation of novel CAR-T cell therapies for the human pharmaceutical industry, potentially resulting in benefits to humans as well as dogs.    This project addresses a major bottleneck in the transition from research phase experimentation to clinical and commercial phase manufacturing. During the research phase, cell engineering platforms that process only 5,000,000 CAR-T cells per gene editing experiment or per manufacturing pilot study are sufficient. However, to expand to clinical scale manufacturing and to reach full market scale treatment of 50,000 dogs per year, the ability to make 50-500 doses per manufacturing run is required. Scaled electroporation systems can process up to 500,000,000 cells in a single experiment, a 100x increase from the research phase system. While the scale-up in cell programming reagents is expected to be 1:100, optimization is likely to be required to reach the same or better cell programming efficiencies, while the downstream outgrowth of this scale-up of cells also needs to be optimized in small scale bioreactors. The proposed engineering platform enables engineering of up to 500 doses of CAR-T cell therapy for under $500/dose at full scale.

More than 37 million patients in the US have chronic kidney disease, which is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, premature death, and progression to end-stage kidney disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2018, treating Medicare beneficiaries with chronic kidney disease cost over $81 billion, and approximately 20% of the Medicare budget was spent on kidney disease. This project leverages a medical device and digital tools with advanced analytics capabilities to provide actionable data and key health insights for timely interventions for at-risk patients. There is a rapid shift towards value-based healthcare from the traditional fee-for-service model accelerated by the significant cost burden and poor outcomes, especially in kidney care management. This solution is designed to facilitate this transition seamlessly, lowering unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations, and minimizing exacerbations and associated healthcare costs in a disease condition that contributes over $100 billion in healthcare expenses.    This STTR Phase II project develops a comprehensive disease management solution for chronic kidney disease by offering a personalized clinical-decision support system for providers as well as a companion diagnostic solution for patients to improve therapeutic benefits. There is a dearth of reliable and accurate predictive tools that can non-invasively measure critical biophysical and biochemical markers to inform clinical care and empower self-identification of undesirable effects. The objective of this research is to develop and validate disruptive technologies for the non-invasive assessment of biomarkers critical to chronic kidney disease diagnosis and management such as hemoglobin levels, electrocardiography (ECG)-based arrhythmia, estimated potassium levels, and lung functions, augmenting the existing capability that measure 10+ vital signs. The innovation also includes a novel concept for any medical device, to record and broadcast personalized messages in a trusted voice (physician/family member), to improve treatment adherence and outcomes. The project further incorporates a proprietary cloud-based analytics system that leverages both subjective and objective data to generate a unique ‘digital fingerprint’ for effective management and triage.

Unintended pregnancies accounted for half of the total pregnancies in 2022, and over 60% of unplanned pregnancies end in abortion, with an estimated 45% of abortions being unsafe, resulting in 5-13% of all maternal fatalities. Today, an estimated 7.5 million women aged 15–49 receive a treatment or hormonal drug via long-term subcutaneous arm implants. Once they reach the end of their lifespan, these implants must be removed, and complications can quickly arise. Not only are these procedures expensive, but they leave behind heavy bruising and scarring and some instances even require an operation for removal. The proposed product is the world’s first biodegradable contraceptive-releasing implant. The technology combines  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved material with a generic drug already on the market.

Endometriosis is a debilitating chronic pain disorder that impacts approximately one in ten women in the United States -  resulting in significant loss of productivity, low quality of life, and greater than $80 billion annual economic burden. This artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot aims to conversationally educate users regarding clinically accepted paradigms of care and options during scenarios including painful endometriosis flare-ups. This project ultimately aims to improve patients' self-knowledge and quality of life, expand access to patients in rural communities to improve endometriosis patient recovery, and reduce the burden of the disease due to lack of knowledge or hesitancy for proper self-care.

Plant-pathogenic microorganisms are ubiquitous in soils across the U.S. and negatively affect the production of vital food crops and the country’s agricultural economy. Understanding the biological mechanisms to infect and colonize plants employed by these microbes is fundamental for the development of effective management approaches. The present project will investigate novel protein factors that are uniquely encoded by a group of plant-associated microbes, including several pathogens responsible for the common scab disease in potatoes and other tubers. Early research indicates that the protein factors endow these pathogens with the ability to deliberately alter their genomic information without changing their DNA, and ultimately can result in the production of multiple protein mutants from a single gene. Why these pathogens encode these dedicated factors and how they function is largely unknown. The goals of this project are to determine the function of these factors and to explore their role in plant pathogenicity of their host species. Importantly, the implementation of this work will involve the training of two postbaccalaureate associates from underrepresented groups in STEM and will offer opportunities for undergraduate students to gain a first-hand research experience.    The genetic code assigns each of the twenty canonical amino acids to one of the 61 sense codons. One of the only two exceptions to the rule of one codon specifying one amino acid was recently discovered in a small group of plant pathogens from the bacterial Streptomyces family, including Streptomyces turgidiscabies and Streptomyces scabiei. These organisms, which are the causative agents of distinct tuber diseases that cause substantial economic losses to U.S. farmers, encode an anomalous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and a corresponding tRNA. Expression of these factors causes translation of alanine codons as proline. This dual use of alanine codons enables the diversification and expansion of the host’s proteome due to stochastic Ala→Pro mutations, which can generate a multiplicity of protein variants from a single gene. This may provide a rapid response against stress and environmental changes as well as a mechanism for virulence and infection. This project will combine biochemical, biophysical, multi-omics, comparative genomics, genetics, and molecular biology approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions and features that enabled the emergence of these translation factors and to explore their biological function in the pathogenic Streptomyces hosts.

Antibiotic resistance is a global public health crisis, and “one of our most serious health threats” according to the CDC. The world has witnessed a surge of superbugs that elude one or more antibiotics at an alarming rate. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of new antibiotics in the pipeline and increasing accumulation of artificial antibiotic wastes in natural habitats that further accelerates resistome development. Membrane-active antimicrobials (MAAs) have been widely anticipated to be promising candidates for new antibiotics. However, toxicity is one of the biggest barriers to the translation of MAAs to the market, of which the indiscriminate hydrophobic interaction that disrupts both bacterial and mammalian membranes is a major contributing factor.  The proposed technology uses hydrophilic nanoantibiotics that kill bacteria, including multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains, highly efficiently without damaging mammalian cells.  In addition, they have been shown to undergo rapid degradation and deactivation by enzymes that exist in natural habitats when released as wastes.  This technology potentially may be used to solve the crisis of antibiotic resistance.    This I-Corps project is based on the development of biocompatible and environmentally benign nanoantibiotics. The proposed technology has demonstrated that assembly of hydrophilic and antimicrobial inactive linear-chain polymers into nanostructured polymer molecular brushes (PMBs) turns “ON” their antimicrobial activities collectively, while disassembly of the nanostructured PMBs turns the acquired activities “OFF”. In addition, nanoantibiotics have been shown to kill bacteria by selectively disrupting the bacterial membranes while remaining benign to mammalian cells. Because this mode of damage acts on bacterial membranes instead of targeting biosynthetic pathways as conventional antibiotics do, it is extremely difficult for bacteria to produce resistant strains. Nanoantibiotics low toxicity to mammalian cells further suggests that they have a great potential for clinical use.  In addition, the environmentally degradable nanoantibiotics help solve the long-standing problem of continuous accumulations of antibiotic wastes in natural habitats, which alters the structure and function of the microbial community in sensitive ecosystems, threatens food and water security, and accelerates the development of the resistome.  The development of environmentally degradable nanoantibiotics may represent a milestone in the search for new antibiotics and may have commercialization potential to fight drug-resistant bacterial infections.

Some of those atoms can make their way into the bone itself; more specifically they can get inside the hard part of your bones which is made up of a mineral called apatite. The movement of these atoms into the apatite can change the way your bones work, making them more likely to break. However, because the apatite minerals in your bones are extremely small, it has been very difficult to study where these heavy metal ions go and how they affect bone strength. The goal of this project is therefore to use a combination of computer modelling and experiments using very powerful X-rays to figure out where the metal atoms go in the apatite mineral and determine whether or not they make the bone more breakable. By combining computer models and experiments, techniques will be developed that allow researchers to understand how metal atoms interact with bone apatite and predict how those atoms affect bone strength in the millions of people with cobalt and chromium containing bone implants. Integrated with this research, the principal investigators will strive to create environments that make students more confident about their scientific abilities. This will be done by providing opportunities for students to work in the lab, by teaching inclusive classes that reach broad audiences, and by acting as role models for students in scientific roles.     Technical Abstract:  Degradation of cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) containing implants are associated with release of heavy metal ions and an increase in bone fracture risk. Since bone is primarily composed of apatite mineral which exhibits a high propensity for cationic substitutions, it is likely that the bone matrix is absorbing these ions resulting in significant changes in crystal structure and mechanics. The principal investigators hypothesize that the incorporation of cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) in the near-implant bone plays a significant role in promoting fracture. However, due to the difficulty in studying nano-sized apatites, there remain several unanswered questions relative to this process including how Co and Cr substitute into apatite, how the ions affect the apatite mechanical properties, and what Co and Cr concentrations are needed to affect bone fracture. To answer these questions, an ab initio-based model of apatite crystals with Co and Cr substitutions will be developed to predict the change in crystallographic and mechanical properties of apatite crystals at the nanoscale. These predictions will be validated by experimental approaches using biomimetic apatite systems and high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. These data will be combined to create multiscale models of apatite crystals to study fracture initiation processes due to Co and Cr substitutions. The results from this study can benefit millions of North Americans with cobalt-chrome implants by creating a new avenue for treatment developments to minimize fracture in this already at-risk population. In addition, they will facilitate the tunability of apatite biomaterials for future bone graft and scaffolding applications. Integrated with the research, is an educational plan which seeks to increase self-efficacy in the realm of science for a variety of students.

Objectives include to 1) developing an outpatient summarization model and demonstrating the ability to produce summaries that semantically match reference text with a high level of fluency, 2) validating the utility of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated outpatient summaries to provide significant value to physicians, 3) evaluating the ability of AI-generated summaries that provide information relevant to future patient visit through ablation study, and 4) incorporating checks for bias in the existing model.

The proposed technology is based on using 3D printing design technology to generate oral therapy devices that are custom fit to the individual patient. Currently, traditional fabrication methods for oral appliance therapy to treat OSA are costly, and the average wait time is 3 weeks. This can lead to patient non-compliance and/or delays in treatment of OSA. The goal is to create a device that is more comfortable, effective, and non-invasive and provides additional treatment options for patients with OSA.  The proposed generated devices may then be worn by patients to treat OSA through nightly wear, which may reduce the societal impacts of sleep apnea and healthcare costs.    This I-Corps project is based on the development of point-of-care manufacturing of devices to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  The proposed technology is based on advancements in additive technology to allow low-cost, custom fabrication of digitally designed oral appliances.  Oral appliance (OA) therapy uses a device to protrude the jaw in a more anterior position during sleep to treat obstructive sleep apnea.  It may be used as an alternative to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy or as a combination therapy. Oral appliance therapy has been shown to have higher compliance rates than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  Point-of-care manufacturing eliminates the need for expensive manufacturing equipment or individually hand-made OA that increase treatment costs and prevent access to care for patients.  In addition, the patient wait time for point-of-care manufactured devices may be reduced from weeks to hours.

The proposed software tool is designed to determine burn severities and surface area percentages quickly and accurately.  Currently, medical professionals use a visualized method to look at wounds and determine burn severities and to estimate burn percentage versus unburned skin.  This may result in a wait of 3-7 days during which time doctors determine the burn degree by comparing pictures from the first day and following days of continuous monitoring.  The proposed image processing and machine learning algorithm may provide clinicians with the ability to predict total burn surface area, expected resuscitation amount, delineate second- and third-degree burns, as well as prognosticate indeterminate-degree burns.  The proposed technology may reduce ICU cost for both patients and hospitals, and may allow for better, more efficient patient care, better survival, and better functional outcomes.    This I-Corps project is based on the development of a machine learning algorithm to process imaging from burn patients.  The proposed assist tool is designed to determine the total body surface area of burns using an image capture technology.  Image capture technology may be used to calculate total body surface area based on image recognition of burned areas, providing physicians and other medical personnel with more objective data on which to base resuscitation.  In addition, the proposed technology may be used to delineate between full thickness and partial thickness of burn injuries.  Also, it may be used to delineate between operative and non-operative indeterminate thickness burn injuries. Burn wounds are always evolving, and based on the depth of a burn injury, an operation may be required. The lengthy observation period with current visual methods exposes patients to infection, hospital-related comorbidity, and life-altering hospital cost. Using image capture technology and machine learning to analyze a standardized image of burn injuries to delineate between operative and non-operative burns may mitigate these risks.

This will lead to insights into the mechanisms coupling between cell cycle differentiation for cell growth and development. The tools will significantly improve our understanding of stem cells, germinal cells and tissue development and functions.  The ML methods can be modified and applied to other general problems in biology. Graduate and undergraduate students will work under this project and gain experience in doing leading-edge research.       The project will develop two ML approaches: integrated sinusoidal and piecewise autoencoder (SPAE) for cell cycle estimate and cell development study, and cell cycle-aware domain separation network (CADSN) to study the dynamic coupling of cell cycle and differentiation. SPAE employs a distinct sinusoidal autoencoder to characterize the circular process in the cell cycle and piecewise autoencoder to capture the inherent nonlinear data structure in high-dimensional space, formed by single cells sampled from various stages of a periodic process. This model can also characterize the connections between the cell cycle and cell development while it effectively unfolds the circular manifold onto a non-linear space to obtain precise pseudo-time. Secondly, CADSN is proposed for multi-omics single-cell data integration and label transfer. An autoencoder-based cell-cycle-aware domain separation network is proposed to predict and remove cell cycle effects from the integrated multi-omics single-cell data while keeping the cell type-specific heterogeneity. This is the first computational model to study the cell-cycle effect in the integrated analysis for multi-omics single-cell data. Finally, some of the inferred results will be experimentally validated by using the team’s established models.

Heart-failure is a cardiovascular disease that is particularly challenging given that many patients end up readmitted to the hospital just months after initial hospitalization. Greatly improved outcomes for patients are already possible, keeping patients from returning to the hospital, but only if the patient treatment can be rapidly optimized for the medications prescribed for heart failure. This rapid optimization requires multiple trips back to the doctor for blood tests to guide the treatment plan, adjusting patient medication levels accordingly. Cardiologists have therefore been asking for new technologies to aid their ability to care for heart-failure patients, with an increasing call for remote monitoring technology.     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create the first-ever wearable, heart-failure monitor for a peptide molecule released by the heart when the heart is struggling, therefore providing a direct and continuous measurement of how well heart-failure treatment is progressing. Specifically, aptamers, which are oligonucleotides, will be used to capture heart-failure peptide molecules on a tiny electrical wire sensor embedded painlessly a few millimeters beneath the skin surface. As these aptamers capture the peptides, they provide a continuous measurement of the peptide concentrations in the form of an electrical signal. The project will create a working prototype that is like the proven success of wearable continuous glucose monitors, leveraging decades of investment in glucose monitors and significant doctor and patient trust in glucose monitors. Under the Phase II project, the wearable heart-failure monitor prototype will be validated for more than one week of operation in an animal model, a key proof point that will enable further commercial investment in developing the wearable heart-failure monitor for human use.

Health-based POC-AM is a non-traditional form of manufacturing referring to the just-in-time creation of anatomical models, surgical instruments, prosthetics, scaffolds, etc., based on medical imaging data and need at the place of patient care. The growth of POC-AM requires the collaboration of medical, engineering, and social science professionals in that engineers must be trained to be socially adept and communicative about additive manufacturing specifically for healthcare applications. Despite the exponential growth in POC-AM market value and scholarly activities, the needed education and training components are underdeveloped, especially for undergraduate students in public engineering schools. This IUSE Engaged Student Learning Level 2 project will bridge this talent gap by creating an undergraduate engineering course that is broadly accessible and will be able to define, cultivate, and assess students' technical and professional skills needed by the booming POC-AM industry. This project features a project-based learning plan to develop students' theoretical and hands-on skills to create a broad range of medical objects from non-patient-specific personal protection equipment and anatomical models to patient-specific prosthetics, tissues, and implants. This project will strongly emphasize the development of students' reflective communication skills, both written and verbal, with colleagues in both engineering and in healthcare. The project will also design a protocol for assessing and developing those communication skills using objective and subjective metrics.    Thus, the goal of this project is to remove barriers between POC-AM research and education while interconnecting key concepts in multiple related sub-disciplines through teaching this unique skillset to undergraduate students at two large public universities. The innovative course that focuses on students' technical and communication skills development will train holistic and well-rounded engineering students who can solve complex problems that require a broad integration of technical knowledge and communication skills. The combination of cutting-edge learning about POC-AM and a targeted and efficient communication skills development targeted to the needs of the post-COVID student population makes this project highly effective for undergraduate education.

Utilizing printable bioink materials combined with cells, 3D bioprinting offers an unprecedented ability to build cell-containing 3D structures that replicate the complex multicellular patterns and geometries of native tissue. A key approach to studying these cell interactions is by introducing new genetic material to cells to change their behavior in a defined way and controlling when and where the cells receive these genetic instructions. However, it is challenging to achieve this control in 3D printed structures using current approaches, as the 3D construct presents a physical barrier to gene delivery. Addressing this challenge, this project will develop a new 3D printable bioink that allows deep-penetrating ultrasound to trigger the delivery of genetic material to cells. The ultrasound waves can be focused to small spots within the 3D bioprinted structure to create desired patterns of gene delivery by activating embedded ultrasound-responsive particles. This project will produce new fundamental knowledge about how embedded ultrasound-responsive particles affect the material properties of the printable bioinks and will determine how bioink material properties affect ultrasound-induced particle activation. These novel materials will allow researchers to study new aspects of cell behavior in tissue-relevant 3D geometries. This project will also enable new materials for use in regenerative medicine applications where remote genetic manipulation of cells at specific times after implantation can instruct cellular communication and improve healing of damaged tissue. This project will develop educational activities that engage all students at multiple levels in 3D bioprinting and responsive biomaterials research, providing mentorship opportunities and fostering retention in STEM. Broader reach of this work will also be facilitated through development of interactive workshops to introduce 3D printing research to middle and high school students, as well as accessible 3D biofabrication modules to promote public interest in bioprinting and responsive biomaterials.    TECHNICAL SUMMARY    3D bioprinting is a major advance allowing direct formation of cell scaffold structures that closely mimic the multi-component architecture of native tissues. However, it is a challenge to apply the critically important tool of genetic manipulation to influence cell behaviors within 3D scaffolds with temporal and spatial control because scaffolds hinder diffusion of traditional transfection vectors. Overcoming diffusional barriers to enable genetic control over subsets of cells within scaffolds is essential for developing new biomaterials to replicate and perturb genetic expression patterns found in native tissue. This project focuses on fundamental development and characterization of a new class of biomaterials that combine a novel ultrasound-responsive 3D scaffold cell culture platform with 3D-printable bioinks to enable remote spatiotemporal control over genetic manipulation of embedded cells. The three main objectives are to: (1) understand how embedded ultrasound-responsive particles affect scaffold material properties, (2) determine how bioink material properties affect ultrasound-induced particle cavitation, and (3) characterize ultrasound-patterned DNA delivery to cells within multicellular 3D-bioprinted scaffolds. Multi-level integrated education activities will create research and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in new stimuli-responsive bioink research, supporting student engagement and retention. Outreach and education efforts will also include interactive activities to introduce 3D printing technology to students at the middle and high school level, and dissemination of accessible 3D biofabrication education modules as a resource to increase public knowledge and interest in biomaterials.

Exposure to NTM can cause chronic and difficult to treat lung disease in people globally that is acquired through inhalation of these bacteria or ingestion through contaminated tap water. In the United States, Hawai’i is a widely recognized hot spot for NTM infections. On August 8-9 a deadly wildfire of yet unknown cause completely burned grasslands and destroyed hundreds of buildings and homes in the historic town of Lāhainā. There are many concerns including toxic ash exposure and compromised water systems. The acute and long-term repercussions on this community are uncertain but may include negative effects on lung health for Lāhainā residents and because wildfire pollutants can travel over long distances, the fire may also have affected neighboring islands. Recognition of respiratory bacterial infections in the aftermath of wildfires is a challenge that needs a much clearer understanding particularly in the wake of the ever-increasing frequency of fires and other similar natural disasters. Project results will be combined with previously collected data on environmental NTM diversity and volcanic exposures in the State of Hawai’i collected before the Lāhainā inferno to learn significantly more about environmental factors that increase NTM risk in the community.     Extreme, deadly wildfires are increasing in occurrence on a global scale particularly in the context of exacerbating climate change, elevating fires as a significant public health threat. Yet wildfire microbiology with pulmonary implications is an understudied field. In the current proposal, researchers will apply quantitative microbiological, molecular, ecological, and genomic analyses to study the possibility for a “one-two punch” that is, “wildfire-NTM” punch in the context of the Lāhainā inferno. Study objectives include performing timely sampling of the environment as close to the event as possible to include wildfire ash, smoke, water, soil, and dust to elucidate NTM diversity, compare Lāhainā wildfire NTM to pre-existing NTM species diversity in Maui and other neighboring islands before the wildfire, and study fire pollutants as a possible carrier of NTM organisms. By capturing new information regarding NTM within the immediate fire aftermath and by comparing results to before fire data, broader impacts to society include identification of key areas of exposures that increase vulnerability for residents, first responders, and those who choose to rebuild, not only in the context of NTM lung disease but other similar environmentally acquired lung pathogens influenced by growing climate changes.

Despite this importance, how cells coordinate probing their environment with forward movement remains unknown.  This project examines actin cytoskeletal networks and adhesion receptors as integral yet distinct subsystems — akin to an airplane’s wings and tail, which are critical for lift, stability, and steering. Just as both the ailerons and rudder are necessary for an airplane’s maneuvering yet are ineffective in isolation, this project will explore the interdependence of actin network subsystems in steering and powering cell migration. Using nanofabricated matrices designed to direct cellular behavior towards single migration behaviors, the study will identify the parts within each subsystem and how they interact to create matrix-guided migration.  The broader impacts include engaging high school students in cell motility challenge experiments using student-designed nanofabricated matrices and establishing ‘The A-mazing Cell Races’ website to present the results and engage the public with the dynamics of cell biology.  The project’s innovative strategy of forcing a single cellular function and identifying the parts that create the function is a transformative approach to studying complex systems that cannot be separated using traditional biochemical or molecular approaches.     Cells use actin-based protrusions to probe the ECM for places to bind and form anchors to pull themselves forward.  Extensive studies have revealed that protrusions contain multiple actin networks with different structures.  However, understanding each network’s role in probing and forward movement has been limited.  The networks cannot be isolated without inducing compensatory effects, and they cannot probe or bind ECM without receptors. Yet, the networks are not thought to connect to receptors until the receptors bind to ECM. This proposal targets these significant gaps by considering actin networks and ECM receptors as complex systems, an assembly of parts that produces more functionality than its components.  However, as many of us learned as children who took something apart to figure out how it worked and ended up with a box of parts that could not be put back together, some hidden randomness, hierarchy, or collective dynamic essential for functionality disappears when pieces are removed.  This project will study ECM-guided cell migration as a complex system composed of non-separable, hierarchical, interactive, dynamic ECM receptor–actin network subsystems that regulate probing and forward migration.  Using nanofabricated ECM substrates will identify the subsystems and determine how they respond to substrate cues at the cellular, sub-cellular, and single-molecule levels.  Challenging the cells to engage multiple subsystems to navigate complex challenges using ECM mazes will define the subsystem hierarchy of action for each choice and enable the use of graph theory to model cells navigating these complex challenges.

One such response involves the control of gene expression via a process known as alternative polyadenylation (APA). APA is known to impact plant development and to affect the responses of plants to conditions such as elevated temperature or infection by pathogens. However, many questions remain concerning the connections between the cue (developmental or stress) and the protein machinery (the polyadenylation complex) that mediates and regulates APA. This project focuses on where and when in the plant these connections are made, and how these connections affect the composition of the machinery that mediates the process. To this end, a spectrum of tools will be brought to bear – the activity of the complex will be assayed at the single cell and sub-cellular levels, and the composition of this complex will be studied in mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis that lack strategic protein subunits.  This research will lead to a better understanding of the growth and development of crop plants, and their responses to various stresses, the results of which will benefit crop breeding in the future.  This project will also provide training opportunities for postdoctoral scientists, undergraduate students, and faculty from a range of post-secondary institutions.      Eukaryotic messenger RNA polyadenylation is mediated by a large complex (the PolyAdenylation Complex, or PAC). This project will test the model that variability in subunit composition is a key mechanism by which the plant PAC is regulated.  Three aims will be pursued.  One will test the hypothesis that the activity of the PAC varies in specific cells and tissues.  The second will test the hypothesis that the composition of the plant PAC determines its RNA substrate specificity.  The third will test the hypothesis that the composition of the functional plant PAC can vary. A diverse range of experimental approaches will be used.  The activity of the PAC will be assayed in different root cells using single cell transcriptomics approaches. The RNA specificity of the PAC will be assayed in nuclear extracts from cells lacking PAC subunits.  The compositions of complexes affinity-purified from different mutants will be determined by mass spectrometry.

In particular, low participation in graduate school by women and students from certain races and ethnicities (i.e., Black, Hispanic, indigenous) continues to create disparities in the STEM workforce. Graduate preparation programs can help undergraduate students from marginalized groups enroll and succeed in STEM graduate degree programs. These programs can serve students in many ways, from providing mentorship, financial support, peer groups, or through combining multiple support structures. Understanding how students from these marginalized groups are supported in preparing for graduate programs in STEM fields is crucial to support and retain marginalized students in STEM fields, diversify the STEM workforce, and promote equity in STEM education and professions. This project will examine existing studies that focus on STEM graduate preparation programs to explore the approaches that help students apply for graduate school, enroll in a master's or doctoral program, and eventually graduate with an advanced degree.     Drawing from the theoretical foundations of intersectionality and critical capital theory, this project includes a systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative studies that examine graduate preparation program interventions to increase preparation for, enrollment in, and completion of STEM graduate-level degree programs among marginalized groups. The project will (1) determine the overall effect of participation in graduate preparation programs on marginalized students' STEM graduate school preparation, enrollment, or degree completion; (2) identify which program components best support marginalized students' STEM graduate school preparation, enrollment, or degree completion; and (3) uncover which student identity groups do and do not have research on their participation in a graduate school preparation program. Multivariate models with robust variance estimation will be employed. Findings from this project will help the field understand to what extent graduate preparation programs work and specific systemic change levers that are most effective in improving outcomes for students from marginalized groups.

Such impairments make it very hard to use voice, touch, keyboard, and other common ways of interacting with computers. One alternative that can help is ""single-switch"" interaction, where systems allow people to use the muscle control they do have to simulate clicking a single button. For instance, Stephen Hawking famously composed lectures and interview responses with his computer by twitching his cheek; other interfaces use blinking, or puffing air into a special sensor. However, these single-switch interaction methods, and the interfaces built based on them, are much slower and more error-prone than voice, touch, or keyboard interfaces. In this project, the research team collaborates with people with severe disabilities to develop technology to make it faster, easier, and more accurate for this set of people to communicate and use computers. The key general idea is to use additional information about a person's context such as where they are looking, what they have done recently, and other clues to their intentions to help computers guess, and suggest, complicated communication goals based on simple single-switch interactions.    To meet these goals, this project leverages machine learning and a novel user interface to synthesize four currently under-utilized information sources. First, users are likely to be looking at a target when they select it; unlike methods that use eye gaze as a pointer, such passive information requires no conscious eye effort from the user and may provide information even when a user's gaze is not precise enough for selection by itself. Second, modern large language models can often anticipate what a user is interested in writing and can likely learn to leverage contextual clues (e.g., who the user is writing to or topics suggested by a communication partner) with only a small number of training examples. Third, patterns of behavior across users and time can offer clues; for example, similar users may provide information about a new user, or a user might exhibit different behaviors at different times of the day. Fourth, sequences of noisy input actions can jointly inform a desired user action such as writing a word. The project combines these four sources of information with a user's single-switch input to improve speed and accuracy of text entry and computer interaction tasks. This project's innovations are designed and tested with users with disabilities in an extensive, multi-pronged set of participatory design activities and experiments. Participatory design with this set of users is particularly challenging due to their communication speed. This project therefore investigates a novel combination of participatory design methods in which stakeholders provide feedback via an asynchronous messaging platform, in co-design interviews, and via surveys designed to be easily completed with single-switch interaction techniques.

Healthcare professionals (HPs) perform critical tasks in complex environments, facing incomplete and inconsistent information, fluid team dynamics, and complex interactions with technology, among other distractions. Consequently, healthcare presents a high-risk setting for errors. Errors are driven by multiple interrelated factors, such as patient acuity, human factors, team composition, and clinical context. Addressing these factors in isolation fails to capture their interconnected nature. This project adopts a proactive systems approach, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze diverse data sources, including cognitive and emotional states, behavioral patterns, and environmental conditions, to predict errors. Error prediction will leverage AI to determine assistive interventions for HPs that will contribute to the avoidance or reduction of medical errors. This project aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission to support innovative research that benefits society by advancing national health. It builds on ongoing interdisciplinary research at the nexus of human performance, sensing technologies, and human-AI collaboration. Additionally, it offers opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to gain critical research skills for advancing smart and safe healthcare delivery in the age of artificial intelligence. The outcomes of this project may also impact other high-stakes fields like aviation, military training, and emergency response.     This project will develop a novel system to identify cognitive and affective states, behavioral patterns, and contextual factors contributing to medical errors. The system will provide a transparent risk assessment of medical errors and prevent them through AI collaboration with HPs. The research team will implement multi-modal machine-learning algorithms leveraging data from wearable sensors, audio, video, and other contextual sources to predict medical errors. The research involves three main thrusts: (1) investigating the impact of neurophysiological processes on medical error rates, (2) developing multi-modal representation learning to predict healthcare professionals' cognitive states and potential errors, and (3) designing adaptive AI interactions considering human readiness and cognitive resources. A key component is human subject research (HSR), collecting multi-modal data (facilitating system testing and validation) from HPs across various simulated emergency scenarios with varying distractions and error-inducing conditions. The HSR will also compare how healthcare professionals perform under three conditions: (i) no AI support, (ii) constant AI support, and (iii) context-aware AI support based on predicted errors.

This project will explore one genetic mechanism that could help explain those differences: the variation in the timing of DNA replication. This project will measure the progression of DNA replication across the chromosomes of many humans, chimpanzees, and other great apes.  Subsequently, the project will identify differences, reconstruct their evolutionary trajectory, and link DNA replication variation to mutation rates, gene expression and possibly, the evolution of new traits. As part of the societal impact of the project, results will be disseminated to current and prospective veteran undergraduate students, a group which is under-represented in leading universities. Veterans have a high interest in STEM fields but often do not have the same opportunities to engage in biological research. The research will additionally involve undergraduate and graduate students and will develop an accessible platform for visualization of the computational data generated in this project, which will be widely shared with researchers and the public.     DNA is replicated according to a defined temporal order referred to as the DNA replication timing program. DNA replication timing interfaces with gene regulation and influences mutation rates and patterns. As a result, it holds the potential of affecting evolution in non-trivial ways. On the other hand, we know very little about how DNA replication timing has itself evolved. This project will measure DNA replication timing across the genomes of ~100 humans and chimpanzees as well as other great apes, using whole-genome DNA sequencing. The generated replication timing data will be used to identify variations, infer their evolutionary patterns and genetic basis, and link them to human-specific molecular and phenotypic traits. Genes that are known to have evolved since human-chimpanzee divergence will be specifically studied for replication timing variations, and other candidate genes identified based on replication timing divergence patterns. Reciprocally, patterns of replication timing variation among great apes will be used to infer the dynamics of replication timing evolution, including the birth and death of DNA replication origins, and changes in DNA replication timing.

Early identification of disease and disease progression is key in preventing vision loss. Using a novel testing method, this technology will capture VF changes with higher sensitivity and specificity than the current standard of care.

This doctoral dissertation project bridges this knowledge gap by evaluating the contributions of soft and bony tissues to nasal morphology and function in a large sample of living humans under experimentally controlled climatic conditions. The study advances scientific understanding of human climatic adaptation.

This research supports the training of the next generation of scientists through research experiences for undergraduate and medical students, along with unique STEM education opportunities for Texas high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds.    It has been hypothesized that inhalation of cold air and physical exercise cause the nasal mucosa to rapidly decongest. Yet, the degree to which thermal and exertional stimuli actually influence mucosal congestion, and thus nasal airflow dynamics, remains poorly understood. This study employs a non-invasive technique, acoustic rhinometry, to quantify changes in the nasal soft tissue morphology of living human participants during experimental exposures to different thermal conditions and exercise regimes within a climate-controlled environmental chamber. These data are then used to generate 3D digital reconstructions of participant nasal passages during each experimental condition, and subsequently, to quantify respiratory airflow variables (e.g., airstream directionality, velocity, heat/moisture transfer) using Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis.  Resultant measures of nasal soft-tissue morphology and airflow parameters are then assessed in conjunction with CT-derived measures of skeletal anatomy to: (1) explicitly test whether the nasal skeleton reliably predicts soft-tissue nasal morphology, (2) empirically assess proposed functional (i.e., adaptive) benefits of various nasal morphologies in different climates, and (3) potentially identify new skeletal indicators of climatic adaptation.

This includes information on people's movements, social interactions, online searches, social media posts, and immune factors. By combining these diverse data sources, the Investigators aim to detect diseases earlier and gain a more comprehensive understanding of how they spread through communities. The investigators will also examine how public attitudes and behaviors evolve during prolonged health crises. Although the initial focus is on COVID-19, the methods to be developed could be applied to other infectious diseases, helping communities worldwide prepare for future health emergencies. Beyond the research, the investigators are committed to training undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, nurturing the next generation of public health professionals. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable tools for health officials to make quicker, more informed decisions to protect public health.    The goal of this project is to enhance mathematical epidemiological modeling by integrating human behavioral data with wastewater surveillance data, creating a more comprehensive and timely approach to outbreak detection and response. By synthesizing advancements across mathematical modeling, wastewater epidemiology, and geographic information science (GIScience), the research approach innovatively connects human behavior insights with wastewater data to enhance viral transmission understanding and forecasts at the community level. To achieve this, the Investigators will pursue three main objectives: (1) Develop an early-warning system using wastewater and digital and social behavior data; (2) Create a socio-immuno-epidemiological framework to examine the effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions and the emergence of dominant variants using wastewater surveillance data; and (3) Model the impact of pandemic fatigue social behaviors on viral transmission at the community level. These objectives will be addressed by a interdisciplinary research team, which brings together expertise in applied mathematics, epidemiology, public health, and geography. This approach represents a significant step forward in understanding the complex interactions between human behavior, immune responses, and pathogen spread. Ultimately, the research outcomes will equip health officials with valuable tools for designing proactive, targeted, and adaptable interventions, enabling quicker and more informed decision-making.

Current mosquito populations are building resistance to commonly used pesticides, which may increase the spread of pathogens carried by mosquitos that cause diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. This technology provides an alternative that targets mosquito larvae using a formulation that allows for precise application, minimizing environmental impact and avoiding harm to non-target organisms.  In addition, the product is biodegradable and may meet the need for safer and more efficient mosquito control. The goal is to help combat mosquito-borne diseases while providing a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical mosquito control.    This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a mosquito control technology that uses the natural properties of essential oils to create a safer and more effective mosquito larvicide. The challenge with existing larvicides is that they often harm the environment and are becoming less effective as mosquitoes develop resistance. This solution involves encapsulating essential oils in yeast cells, which are a favorite food of mosquito larvae. Encapsulating essential oils into yeast protects the oils from breaking down and reduces the risk of harming other wildlife. This product has been tested successfully in both laboratory and field trials, as well as against mosquito larvae that have developed resistance to traditional larvicides. The product is non-toxic to humans and other mammals at the doses used, and is made from food-grade materials, which may enhance public acceptance. In addition, this larvicide may play a key role in reducing mosquito populations and the diseases they spread, offering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly solution for public health.

For example, ""age"", ""smoking or not"", and ""years of smoking"" are features of a patient, which can be used to describe the patient's physical condition, and furthermore, to predict if she or he is likely to get lung cancer. A combination of features could be more helpful to the prediction, e.g., ""age"" minus ""years of smoking"" can be a new feature to indicate how early the patient starts smoking. This kind of feature combination is called feature generation. In the big data era, there exist enormous numbers of features, and it is not realistic to generate features manually by human experts. This project will build new technologies to automatically generate new features based on existing features, to better describe the objects and entities, and to gain better prediction performance. Additionally, this project aims to substantially improve the traceability, affordability, and explainability during the generation process. The developed algorithms and tools are expected to be generalized and applicable to a broad range of scientific and engineering problems, not just in feature generation, but also in other domains such as data pre-processing, social analysis, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare, and the internet of things.     This project identifies three research tasks: (i) A Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to realize traceability. Two RL agents are used to select appropriate features, and one RL agent is used to select the appropriate operation. The policy network will be decomposed into two sub-networks, i.e., representation network and value network. Different agents will share the value network to improve training convergence. (ii) A heuristic approach to realize affordability. Information theory-based utility scores will be designed to evaluate features and feature sets, and the heuristic selection strategy will be designed in the generation process. (iii) A Large Language Model (LLM) based approach to realize explainability. The tabular data will be serialized into natural language strings, and comprehensive prompts will be designed incorporating feature generation expertise and domain expertise. The LLM can generate features with explanations by fine-tuning it with prompts. Two strategies will be proposed to compress the prompt. The proposed research will provide novel perspectives and methodologies as to how to generate new features by advancing the understanding and designing new generation strategies.

A binaural beat is an illusion created by the brain when you listen to two tones with different frequencies at the same time (one in each ear), which the brain interprets as a single tone. This technology aims to address the growing demand for non-pharmacological interventions using binaural beat therapy as a form of sound wave therapy to reduce stress, improve focus, and enhance overall mental health. The accessibility, convenience, and customizability achieved at a relatively low cost will give this technology a unique competitive advantage in the health and wellness industry. By providing real-time feedback and personalized recommendations, this software algorithm is poised to make positive contributions in the fields of self-improvement, mental health, and cognitive neuroscience.    This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a user-friendly mobile application that adapts to the user's current brain state using audiowaves in the form of adaptive binaural beats and an electroencephalography (EEG)-guided bio-feedback system. Auditory binaural beats are a method commonly used to alter the brain state that involves an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1000 Hz and with less than a 30 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). The brain integrates the two signals, producing a sensation of a third sound called the ""beat,"" whose frequency is equal to the difference between the two frequencies originating in the superior olivary nucleus of the brainstem. Music-assisted relaxation, which includes binaural beats that alter brainwave patterns to induce relaxation, is widely used in a variety of commercial platforms.

The proposed research will study how humans and other animals’ sensors perceive pressure, heat, and sound, and then send signals that enable one to feel pain, hear, and sense when muscles are moving, lungs are filling, and even when stomachs are full. The perception of force and heat at the atomic level is a complicated process. Our sensors are proteins that are embedded in the outer layer, or membrane, of a cell. How these sensors and other membrane-imbedded proteins respond to external stimuli provides information on how they move and function. Computer simulations are an integral part of modern biological research as they augment many experimental studies and provide a test bed for our ideas on how biological molecules function. The goal of the research is to produce computational tools that have the detail, flexibility, and accuracy to conduct realistic simulations of sensory membrane proteins. This project will enhance the training of a diverse STEM workforce, including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, and extend our nation’s leadership in biophysics.    Ideally, a computational tool should exist to simulate dynamics and predict structure. The sequence-to-structure challenge has largely been solved by AlphaFold2. However, simulating dynamics, especially for large membrane proteins involved in sensing of force and heat, remains a challenge. The research will produce a fast and easy-to-use tool called Upside that has the accuracy to simulate realistic conformational changes in membrane proteins. Upside fills an important niche in the “simulation biosphere”. The model uses 5 atoms and has a multi-position side chain center, and authentic H-bonds. Upside can be used to investigate the dynamics of large membrane proteins for long times with near-atomic resolution. This enables a variety of studies including those on environmental sensing, ion channels and protein folding. Our development of methods to integrate hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX) data with simulations will be beneficial to the computational and experimental communities. Accuracy will be assessed using our validation protocols and the HDX-MS data. These data identify which parts of the protein are most stable making an excellent complement and method to validate simulations. Upside also is an excellent complement to many other computational studies as it can rapidly sample the energy surface and identify regions for exploration by more detailed methods. In addition to experimental validation, Upside will be compared to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

Physical activities like walking and running enhance healing by influencing these cells. Mimicking these mechanical signals offers a promising avenue for creating biotechnologies that accelerate tissue regeneration, reduce medical costs, and improve quality of life. However, designing precise mechanical signals to guide healing and regeneration at the cellular level remains a challenge. This award supports research to quantify the mechanical forces at work inside living cells and determine whether changes in these forces impact how the cells produce and secrete proteins that shape their surrounding environment. Gaining this knowledge could lead to predictive tools that use mechanical forces to control cell behavior, enabling advances in tissue engineering, clinical treatments, and diagnostics for identifying and addressing diseases. The educational efforts will engage engineering students from diverse disciplines, improving their retention and success in research. The research team seeks to also inspire future scientists by partnering with Idaho elementary schools, strengthening the pipeline to careers in science and engineering.    A major technical challenge in developing mechano-biotechnologies for guiding cellular differentiation is the lack of methods to non-invasively measure dynamic changes in intracellular mechanical stresses and gene expression in living cells. This research addresses this challenge by combining confocal imaging and computational finite element modeling to create a digital representation of the cell nucleus and surrounding actin cytoskeleton. The model will allow for the analysis of forces generated by actin cytoskeleton and the quantification intra-nuclear of stresses in a cell-specific manner. The research team will validate the model by experimentally tracking 3D nuclear deformations and advance mechanobiology knowledge by: (1) Developing predictive mechanobiotechnology paradigms to control cell anabolism via externally applied mechanical forces. (2) Producing a foundational, cell-specific dataset that can inform or train clinical imaging modalities, such as CT and in-situ probes, to improve diagnoses of conditions including osteoporosis, hypertension, cancer, and age-related extracellular matrix stiffening.

These ice age cycles occur on roughly 100,000 year timescales and are marked by 100 meter-scale changes in global sea level in response to the growth and retreat of large continental ice sheets. The timing, duration, and magnitude of ice age sea-level fluctuations is largely controlled by changes in Earth’s surface temperature due to variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun and the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our understanding of the complex interactions between Earth’s orbit and greenhouse gases that drive sea-level change remains incomplete. Coastal cave deposits called speleothems provide rare, but valuable constraints on past sea-level change. Speleothems provide an upper limit on the position of the ocean surface, as they form from cavern dripwaters and cannot grow when submerged below sea level and can be precisely dated using U-Th dating or geochronology. For this project, the researcher will produce a novel, speleothem-based sea level record extending back ~400,000 years, covering the last four glacial cycles. This project will improve our understanding of the fundamental physical processes that drive sea-level change during ice age cycles and, by extension, the sea-level rise in a warming world. This is a timely topic, as “what are the rates, mechanisms, impacts and geographic variability of sea level change?” has been highlighted as one of the eight priority science questions by the National Academy of Sciences’ 2015-2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences.    The project will leverage an extraordinary collection of speleothems recovered from presently-submerged Bahamian coastal caves (blue holes) during the late 1980s/early 1990s at depths ranging from 4 to 77 m below present sea level. Such records are exceedingly rare, requiring many years of expensive and risky fieldwork and coordination with experience cave divers. In pursuing the project, the PI will have access to (1) the entire Bahamas collection (~117 speleothems), many of which remain undated, (2) state-of-the-art U-series analytical facilities and (3) cutting-edge microanalytical facilities available at University of Minnesota – Twin Cities (e.g., micro computed tomography [CT], electron probe microanalysis [EPMA]) to assess the physical, chemical and petrologic characteristics of growth hiatus boundaries, which is crucial for determining the precise timing of cave inundation due to sea-level rise. Finally, the results will be evaluated using GIA modelling to place the data in the broader context of global mean sea level. Taken together, this approach will greatly enhance the quality of sea-level information that can be extracted from speleothem-based archives, providing critical constraints on the timing and duration of late Pleistocene sea level change.  Results will be useful to the broader Ocean Sciences community to produce robust sea-level projections to help policymakers, stakeholders and the general public in coastal communities adapt to future sea-level rise. Potential avenues for disseminating project results to the general public include outreach efforts such as the Skype a Scientist program, where the PI has an active record of participation. The PI will also partner with NOAA’s Science on a Sphere program to develop data visualizations that effectively convey key concepts of late Pleistocene sea-level change to a non-specialist audience.

This project aims to reduce one of the major issues driving the economic cost of hospitalizations – length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). An estimated 1.2 million Americans per year require mechanical ventilation while hospitalized. Although critical to a patient’s survival, ventilator use rapidly weakens a person’s respiratory muscles (the diaphragm) and can quickly lead to lung injuries. It is estimated ~40% of ventilator time, is time spent recovering and attempting to wean patients off the ventilator. Prolonged time on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator dependence, failed extubation, and other long-term complications. These risks impact a patient’s well-being with significant implications for healthcare resources as prolonged mechanical ventilation results in 3-4 fold costs versus short-term ventilator use.    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel transtracheal phrenic nerve stimulation device that reduces injury rates caused by mechanical ventilation. The system stimulates the phrenic nerves to induce diaphragmatic contractions thereby increasing the size of the chest cavity and allowing the lungs to inflate such as during normal breathing. In this project the stimulation parameters inducing natural diaphragm contractions will be optimized, an automated algorithm developed for prolonged use as intended, and the external system validated for chronic use using a large animal model study. It is expected this Phase project will result in a robust safe and automatic phrenic nerve stimulation prototype system.

Conventional wastewater treatment methods lack solute selectivity, leading to costly and energy-intensive inefficiencies and thwarting efforts to mitigate emerging contaminants. Waste streams may also contain valuable resources that could generate revenue if recovered. Further, improved water reuse operations are needed to address the growing demand for clean water. The technology presented in this project transcends the existing paradigm by offering a method for the highly selective separation of target solutes from water sources, creating multiple, distinct ionic products and substantially dewatering the feed source. In result, this technology may be used to simultaneously remove unwanted contaminants, recover valuable byproducts, and produce clean water for non-potable reuse. Various industries would benefit from this technology, but the ultimate aim is to lower the financial and infrastructural barriers to advanced treatment and reuse for local communities. By significantly reducing the energy and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment and disposal, and enabling further cost-recuperation through resource recovery, this innovation is poised to greatly enhance the viability of water reuse, ensuring that all communities have access to clean water and healthy ecosystems.    The core technical innovation of the proposed technology lies in its ability to selectively separate specific ions from heterogeneous waste or raw water sources; such selectivity does not exist in current water treatment practice. The technology functions through the strategic implementation of energy-efficient electrochemical processes. This approach surpasses existing treatment conventions by not only performing selective exclusion, but by simultaneously generating four distinct, highly concentrated product streams that are differentiated by ion charge and valence, as well as an additional clean water stream that emerges during product concentration. This NSF SBIR Phase I project will focus on three main tasks: optimizing technical design for maximum solute selectivity and concentration, evaluating separation performance with representative wastewaters from three key industries, and scaling up the system for future pilot testing. Experimentation will validate total concentration and dewatering capacities, but initial estimates suggest products may be concentrated up to 10x their starting values and feed volume may be reduced by up to 88%. Evaluation of different waste effluents will determine the technology’s adaptability and marketability in different contexts.

Some research suggests that children make considerable headway by detecting patterns in what they hear even without any explicit teaching or even knowing what is being talked about (""statistical"" or ""unsupervised"" learning). Indeed, much of the recent progress in ""teaching"" computers to understand language has made use of just this strategy. Even more compelling: numerous experiments have shown that both adults and infants are able to learn at least a little bit about language this way. How much they can learn remains unclear.  A central difficulty is that mathematically, there are many different methods for pattern-detection and it is unclear which one(s) humans use. This is important because some work better than others; and whether unsupervised pattern-detection can help solve the mystery of language learning depends on which method is used. The purpose of this project is to put together a ""challenge suite"": a dataset that can be used to systematically evaluate and compare the possibilities. Such challenge suites have been instrumental in advancing artificial intelligence. This project also serves as a proof-of-concept to determine whether challenge suites are similarly beneficial for the science of learning, and at the same time provide valuable resources and training to the research community.      To develop the challenge suite, the investigators will first conduct a comprehensive, quantitative literature review (meta-analysis) focusing on the largest body of work on unsupervised pattern-detection: adult statistical word segmentation. Aided by outside experimenters,   the meta-analysis  will be used to identify 10-15 key experiments. As a group, these experiments will establish a basic set of facts about adult statistical word segmentation that any theory must account for. For these reasons, the project will focus particularly on theoretically-central phenomena that distinguish different theories.  To measure different aspects of linguistic pattern-detection, each experiment will involve large numbers of subjects (approx. 1,200 each) and a subset of 3-5 experiments with an even larger number (approx. 24,000 each). A tool will be developed to enable researchers to compare any mathematical theory of learning against these data, determining how well it matches human performance. In order to determine how the mathematical theory could learn language,  a database of transcripts of child-directed speech in 3-5 languages will be developed. Each theory will also be tested/trained on the database to see how much it could learn about those languages.  The challenge suite will be made available to all researchers as a download and  also through a website where researchers can submit their models and compare results against those of other models. This work will be publicized to the scientific community through a closing workshop focused on models of unsupervised word segmentation.

The project has three components. First, the project seek to conduct ecosystem discovery to identify the needs of potential users, scope potential partnerships with other open-source projects, and find potential collaborators at non-profits and in industry. Second, the organization and governance activities will be established a formal governing structure and implemented using Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices, including enhanced automated testing, continuous integration, and robust security measures. Finally, community building activities will support existing users and contributors and onboard new collaborators through a series of workshops, hackathons, online tutorials, and targeted lab exchanges.

One research literature suggests that people's pre-educational intuitions about mechanical physics are largely veridical, another literature suggests that these intuitions are largely incorrect, and yet another suggests that they are incorrect in infancy but become veridical even before significant physics education. These seemingly contradictory findings complicate the development of educational interventions, since interventions suggested by one line of research are contraindicated by others. The overarching goal of this project is to start synthesizing and reconciling these different lines of work. The project is inherently interdisciplinary and will depend on new and emerging methods for robust and reproducible research such as automated online testing, citizen science, and advanced analytics. Such tools are increasingly important in human research but relatively little training in them for students is available. Thus, the educational component of this CAREER project will focus on enhancing such training and includes updating an innovative, interactive textbook on computational modeling and analysis, developing and running an intensive summer training program for citizen science; and providing undergraduates with direct, hands-on education. The project is funded as a CAREER award by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literatures on STEM learning, broadening participation, and workforce development.     Multiple research literatures have engaged questions about the nature of intuitive understandings of mechanical physics, but they have often supported discrepant conclusions, thereby making ambiguous what their implications are for the characterization of fundamental cognitive architecture as well as for the design of educational interventions. Moreover, because these conclusions arise from different disciplinary communities studying different populations using different methods, it is not clear whether these discrepancies reflect real differences in how people think about different physical processes in different situations or whether they are simply artifactual. Objective 1 of this project will apply the tools of psychophysics in order to test the reliability of a range of tasks developed in these literatures in an attempt to determine whether differential performance (if any) suggests multiple underlying cognitive systems. Objective 2 will use the tools of developmental psychology to study age-related differences in children on tasks adapted from the range of literatures to see whether the developmental patterns observed by developmental scientists are specific to their methods. Objective 3 will investigate whether the measures developed in these disciplines differentially predict student success in introductory university physics. Thus, the three objectives will systematically assess and compare the stimuli, tasks, and research methods common to the currently-disjoint literatures, allowing for direct comparison and synthesis, with subjects ranging in age from 6 months to adults. All three objectives will involve unusually large and diverse samples --- often by utilizing automated online testing and citizen science -- and advanced analytics. By attempting to reconcile these relatively disjoint literatures, the project will have the potential to contribute to the development of educational interventions in physics at a variety of ages.

By reducing the burden on physicians the tool could addresses pressing issues like medical errors, patient safety, and provider burnout.  Commercially, the proposed approach could provide the potential to streamline clinical workflows, improve revenue reimbursement, and reduce administrative burdens for healthcare providers. Its integration with national health information  exchanges and leading electronic health record systems positions it as a pivotal tool for digital health companies and medical institutions, creating a scalable solution with broad market applicability.    The proposed project addresses the critical challenge of reducing the time burden associated with processing unstructured electronic health records while ensuring the accuracy and comprehensiveness of patient care. Physicians often lack adequate tools to quickly  synthesize patient histories, which can lead to missed follow-ups, medical errors, and inefficiencies.

By integrating state-of-the-art models and a federated learning structure to address data-sharing constraints, the project aims to ensure adaptability across various healthcare environments. Anticipated technical  results include high-fidelity summaries, robust integration with electronic health record systems, and real-time capabilities for physicians to access and query patient records. The research scope includes fine-tuning large language models, implementing  speech-to-text integrations, and developing retrieval-augmented generation systems for personalized physician queries.

NOM plays significant roles in many biogeochemical/environmental processes and in almost all cases, these processes involve redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions that occur on the surfaces of particulate materials such as minerals and microbes. To characterize these reactions, the project will use a suite of electrochemical methods to measure electron transfer to and from samples of NOM with varying size and shape. The results will have a wide range of potential applications, including modeling of air pollution, management of agricultural soils, and optimization of drinking water disinfection. As well as graduate students, the project team will include interns from several nearby colleges that have strong programs for including undergraduate students in research.    Reactions of NOM with the surfaces of minerals (and microbes) require sufficient proximity between the redox-active moieties in NOM and redox-active sites on the surface. This proximity is strongly dependent on the size and shape of the NOM, which can vary from discrete monomers to unfolded polymers to aggregates and other supramolecular structures like micelles. These effects can be studied electrochemically, since electrode response to NOM also is an interfacial process that is strongly dependent on NOM size/shape. The overarching technical objective of the proposed project will be to determine qualitative and quantitative relationships between the size and structure of NOM and its redox potentials, kinetics, and capacities using a complementary suite of electrochemical methods that allows for resolution of the many complex interactions involved. In the process, we expect to address several fundamental, cross-cutting issues regarding NOM redox chemistry, including that its bulk redox properties are the net effect of multiple redox active moieties that are linked by intra-molecular transfer, and that its capacity for electron exchange/storage reflects both labile and kinetically-limited components to varying degrees depending on operational factors.

Despite the growing trend of analyzing such complex data to further our understanding of the molecular basis in states of human disease, the inherent biological heterogeneity is challenging the conventional paradigm to treat a given diseased system as a uniform entity: patients may form different disease subtypes present with variable clinical outcomes, and cells collected from the same patient sample may display different phenotypic states. Biological and clinical interpretability in the face of the high dimensional molecular features remain to be another challenge. The proposed project will address key challenges in: 1) simultaneously detecting biologically/clinically meaningful patient/cell subgroups and extracting their unique defining genomic features; and 2) integrated learning from data of multiple modalities, with strong systematic batch effect, or collected over time. Thus, the proposed work has high potential to discover new knowledge and to induce new approaches significant to health data science research. The project will result in algorithms, such as high dimensionality reduction, clustering and data integration, that are broadly applicable across the whole of data science, to address a wide range of research and industry needs.    This project proposes novel ideas of disentangled learning to simultaneously address the high dimensionality and inherent heterogeneity issues for three most popular biomedical data types: multi-omics, tissue resolved -omics, and longitudinal -omics data. The following three critical challenges are to be addressed: 1) Detecting biologically/clinically meaningful patient subgroups by leveraging multi-omics data through novel supervised clustering methods; 2) Discovering heterogeneous cell populations in noisy tissue resolved omics data and multi-task learning of multiple tissue samples through a Poisson based low dimensional embedding model; and 3) Characterizing heterogeneous disease trajectories using longitudinal and high dimensional -omics data through a fusion learning model. For all three scenarios, a common theme of disentangled learning is proposed to ensure the biological/clinical interpretability of the analysis results. The inherent heterogeneity within and across the subjects are divided to distinct subgroups or subpopulations, each of which is characterized by their unique features extracted from within a high dimensional feature space. All proposed methods are embraced with extensive utility in both academia and industry. Educationally, the proposed peer learning education module, R Shiny based tool development research, and summer workshops on data science, all targeting high school and undergraduate students, can well serve as a platform not only for inspiring and retaining students, but also training them for future STEM workforce roles.

With the advent of single cell multi-omics (scMulti-seq) biotechnology, researchers can study the  biological functions of a complex biological system at the cellular resolution. The integrative  analysis of scMulti-seq data and multiple study objects produces a wealth of rich information that enables the characterization of species or tissue specific biological functions, and at the same  time, poses great challenge on how to identify and extract biologically meaningful data patterns. Though substantial amount of efforts has been made to interpret data patterns in single cell multi omics data, most of the existing methods focused on unsupervised learning in a completely data driven manner without considering the rich existing knowledge. In addition, depending on the  types of biological functions, their underlying mathematical representation forms are different in scMulti-seq data. This calls for systems biology models and machine learning concepts to target  true biological functions from scMulti-seq data. The first challenge to study biological functions  from scMulti-seq data is to derive the data patterns that correspond to true biological functions and develop proper computational models for specific biological mechanisms and pathways. The  second challenge lies in the difficulty of knowledge representation and sharing across the studies  for different species, tissue types and experimental conditions. There remains an urgent need to integrate knowledge derived from disparate data sources to optimize the biological functional  modeling, such that the learned knowledge could be utilized to study other biological systems or  data types and promote the generation of new hypotheses. The PI’s long-term career goal is to develop mathematical formulations and computational  methods to model biological functions from multi-omics data.     This project will develop new  mathematical models and an advanced computational framework to optimize the mining of  biological functions, by integrating scMulti-seq data with context specific and general knowledge  derived from independent data sets or experiments. The PI's research team will achieve the goals  through the following three objectives. First, a novel subspace representation model will be  developed to identify transcriptional regulation and functional gene modules. The proposed  method will be empowered by a novel local low-rank matrix detection method to detect gene co regulation modules and a meta-learning framework to optimize results interpretation. Second, the  PI's research team will develop a new graph neural network architecture to estimate cell-wise  functional activities for flux carrying networks and a graph data clustering method to identify cell  groups with varied functional states and distinct pathways. Thirdly, a knowledge graph will be  constructed to represent the biological functions derived from scMulti-seq data, which enables the  integration of independent knowledge derived from literature data and development of new  biological hypotheses. The project is expected to deliver novel computational tools that can  effectively explore biological functions from a wide range of heterogeneous datasets, and it could  provide new capabilities for functional interpretation of individual data sets by maximizing the utilization of existing scMulti-seq and literature data, and reasoning of new biological hypotheses  and mechanisms.

The mission of this Center is to study coastal margins using integrated observation and prediction technologies as critical infrastructure for research, education, and knowledge transfer. The STC will advance the understanding of coastal margins in general and of the Pacific Northwest coastal margin in particular by creating the scientific infrastructure necessary to obtain reliable quantitative descriptions and analyses of integrated physical, chemical, and biological variables in estuaries, freshwater plumes, and continental shelves. The rationale for this Center is that coastal margins are among the most densely populated and developed regions in the United States. As interface systems between rivers and oceans, coastal margins sustain highly productive ecosystems and resources, are sensitive to many scales of variability, and play a key role in global elemental cycles. There is a critical need for better understanding of coastal margins and the stresses placed on them by natural events and human activities. This proposed STC is timely in the emerging context of NSF and national initiatives on ocean-observing systems and will provide the leadership, long-term commitment, and intellectual critical mass of a STC is necessary to enable researchers to focus effectively on transformative technological and scientific opportunities to solve major science questions on coastal margins. STC research will be driven by grand challenges in coastal margin understanding: How do climate and climate change impact coastal margins? What roles do coastal margins play in global elemental cycles? How far seaward do human activities impact ecosystems? Research will be organized into 3 overlapping themes: I. Coastal Margin Observatories, where the STC will generate crucially needed, long-term physical, chemical, and biological information through tightly integrated observations and predictions; II. Coastal Margin Science, where environmental information products will be used to gain novel understanding of ecosystem variability and connectivity, through the exploration of 4 hypotheses addressing the variability of microbial communities, biological productivity, and carbon fluxes with climate and water use; and III. Enabling Technologies, where technological challenges to long-term observations and simulations will be overcome by developing, evaluating, and enhancing   enabling technologies in: (a) modeling and simulation; (b) sensors and platforms, and (c) information and visualization. A combination of long-term core projects and annually funded seed, augmentation, and integrative projects will allow the STC to maintain a balance between continuity and flexibility of research efforts.    To prepare students including females and underrepresented minorities for careers in science, industry, and management, the STC will offer multiple educational opportunities. The objective is to foster a long-term educational pipeline by developing in K-12 students a lifelong interest in science and technology, by creating opportunities for college students to integrate research and industry experiences in their studies, and by preparing graduate students for leadership in their careers.   Knowledge Transfer: The STC will engage a spectrum of stakeholders in a multi-directional exchange of information. In particular, the STC will: (a) be an intellectual magnet and a resource for the ocean-sciences community and for such disciplines as information sciences and molecular biology to help shape next-generation oceanography; (b) enable industries to work with researchers and educators, as opposed to just serving as vendors and contractors; and (c) lend expertise and scientific information to regional and federal agencies for management of PNW coastal margin resources.     Intellectual Merit: The STC will create a coastal margin observatory, as its primary infrastructure for research, education, and knowledge transfer. This observing system will be a configurable integration of heterogeneous modeling systems and observation networks, designed to remove a fundamental barrier to coastal margin science: the lack of long-term descriptions and analyses of physical, chemical, and biological parameters. While other ocean-sciences observatories exist or are planned (e.g., LEO-15, VENUS, MARS), this system will be unique in its integration of river-to-ocean environments and in the multiplicity and level of coordination of its components and enabling technologies, including new approaches to sensing. The proposed science addresses challenging hypotheses and relates regional ecosystem variability to climate and water use in PNW coastal margins. The expectation of transformative understanding is high due to improved capabilities of observation and prediction, and due to the proposed mechanistic, molecular-level approaches to understand the structure, activity and response to environmental stress of microbial communities.   Broader Impacts: Coastal margins have enormous economic and social importance, they are highly vulnerable to change, and their complexity makes a balanced management of marine resources and societal needs difficult: (a) Economic and social importance: Coastal areas comprise less than 20% of the contiguous US, but support more than 50% of the US population. Over a trillion dollars of coastal infrastructure are deployed in the US alone every year; (b) Vulnerability: Natural and man-made hazards in coastal areas cost the US more than $2 billion annually. In addition, reduction of wild salmon diversity in the PNW is a dramatic example of ecosystem vulnerabilities that can only be defused by anticipating impacts decades before their manifestation; and (c) Complexity: The complexity of coastal margins presents enormous challenges for the sustainable management of one of the most productive environments available to humans challenges that the proposed STC will help society meet.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Mission critical domains usually require continuous, high reliability operations in environments that are inherently unpredictable and sensitive to external events and threats. Examples of such domains include disaster responses, space missions, air transportation, military operations, industrial processing plants, financial institutions and hospitals. In such domains, information transfer always has implications for responsibility due to reliability and accountability requirements.     Workers often convene under extreme time pressure with the need to communicate often-complicated, yet safety-critical information in a short period of time with maximum reliability and efficiency. Interactions during such convening are ""critical discourses."" Information technology plays an increasingly important role in supporting collaborative work. Designing next generation technology-embedded environments as part of collaborative systems depends upon our understanding of how rapid transfer of information and responsibility is achieved and how it might be enhanced, particularly during critical moments. The research will examine the phenomenon of critical discourses through field studies and field experimentation in one type of high stakes domain: intensive care units. The field studies are focused on essential issues related to rapid transfer of information and responsibilities, and the field experimentation is to further our understanding of embedded technology as part of collaborative systems.    Critical discourses are carried out through and are shaped by the information arena. Field studies will delineate the roles of information objects, which are often created by workers themselves through adaptation of information technology and are part of joint cognitive environments created by workers. This phase of the research will investigate and contrast three different types of hospital rounds (walking-rounds, sit-down rounds, and discharge rounds), and extend the findings to information transfer during cardiac surgery. Ethnographic methodologies as well as analysis of video records of hospital rounds will be used to develop a conceptual model of how participants in critical discourses create and interact through the information arena to achieve information transfer and to negotiate common interpretation of information. The model will describe structures of extreme discourses and main shaping factors of structures, such as preparatory activities, time pressure, and barriers to timely access to information. It will also depict stages and modalities of information transfer. The field experimentation will interject a large computer display to enhance the information arena. Analysis of interaction patterns with the display will further develop the conceptual model of critical discourses.     Information technology tools (e.g., large computerized displays and group decision-support systems) have typically been designed for tasks that are highly structured, with minimal time pressure and stable collaborators. Understanding critical discourses would provide insights for new generations of supporting tools that are likely to be used in mission critical domains. This research will deepen our understanding of information-transfer and responsibility-transfer in time-critical and safety-critical periods and provide new concepts and directions for the development of computer supported cooperative work tools that capitalize on the power of information technology.

Dynein is one of the fundamental motor molecules that drive movements in eukaryotic cells. Its microtubule-based activities are essential for many forms of membrane-bound organelle transport, often working in cooperation with the other motor proteins, kinesin and myosin.  Specific forms of dynein are required for assembly of the spindle that separates the chromosomes during mitosis, and for chromosome attachment, as well as in mechanisms used to position spindles and orient the sites where the spindle fibers separate after chromosome separation is complete.  This project addresses how the dynein motor works, emphasizing regulation and its coordination with opposing motor activities. Dr. Koonce's laboratory has demonstrated a role for dynein as a force-generating anchor of the microtubule array between mitoses (interphase). Overexpression of dynein motor domain fragments causes a dramatic collapse of the microtubule array in the slime mold, Dictyostelium, resulting in robust centrosome movements through the cytoplasm. Microtubules remain attached to and form a trailing ""comet tail"" as the centrosome moves. Not only dynein, but manipulations to two interacting proteins, Lis-1 and Ndel-1, also produce this phenotype and thus are hypothesized to form a regulatory network that controls dynein movement. The primary objective here tests this hypothesis and seeks to determine how Lis-1 and Ndel-1 regulate the motor. Recent laser microbeam cutting of the comet-like microtubule arrangements demonstrate that their movement results from motors that push on the trailing microtubules. A second objective tests the idea that decreased dynein activity allows kinesin-like motors to push without opposition, and thus interphase microtubule networks are arranged through a balance of both dynein-pulling and kinesin-pushing forces. Finally, in the third objective, an optical trap formed by laser beams will be used on individual molecules to determine the contributions of a lever-arm mechanism to dynein force production, and address how the regulatory machinery may modify this powerstroke. Overall, the project addresses force producing mechanisms that are universal in eukaryotic cells. Dictyostelium offers a multifunctional system in which these forces are exaggerated, and thus highly amenable to study. To date there is very little understanding of how these important proteins are regulated, and if successful, Dr. Koonce's efforts will elucidate a fundamental understanding of how motility is coordinated.

However, an unresolved question in mammalian olfaction is how these biologically relevant odorants traverse perireceptive olfactory mucous environments to interact with cognate odorant receptors?  The extensive dual olfactory system of the macrosmatic Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) offers novel and valid investigative advantages to resolve the source-to-sink molecular trail of two identified pheromones:  Z-7-dodecenyl acetate (Z7-12:Ac) and frontalin.  The recent discovery of two natural enantiomeric forms of frontalin required in a specific ratio for biological activity is a significant mammalian finding, providing an exquisitely precise chemical model.  Our productive international collaboration has described the functional roles of an albumin transporter and an odorant-binding protein sequestrant prior to the final step when the pheromone transits through the long vomeronasal duct before contacting vomeronasal organ (VNO) receptors.  Preliminary results support the hypothesis of passage facilitation by a mucous protein.    Three research questions are explored: (1) Is there a particular protein in VNO ductal mucus that specifically binds Z7-12:Ac and frontalin enantiomers, consequently transporting them?  The study will employ plentiful synthetic pheromones and innovative radiolabelled and photoaffinity visualization analogs.  (2) What is the identity of this vomeronasal ductal protein (VDP) and does its recombinant form retain bioactivity?  After the protein has been isolated and identified and its gene cloned and sequenced, sufficient amounts will be expressed recombinantly.  (3) Does the VDP with its ligand have appropriate biochemical properties (e.g., binding kinetics) and bioactive attributes to be the VNO ductal transporter?    In elephants, spatial and temporal slowing and separation of individual biochemical events allows entire sequences of perireceptive events to be discerned as discrete steps.  In vitro kinetic analyses of VDP-pheromone complexes will be conducted in parallel with in vivo monitoring of discrete-in-time chemosensory responses and behaviors.    This study is multidisciplinary and integrates diverse scientific disciplines, from molecular biology and proteomics through chemosensory bioassays and behavior, integrating the common theme of biochemistry, providing a unique opportunity to quantify responses to pheromones, and elucidating specific and functional protein-ligand associations and transport phenomena.    Investigations by the international team of Drs. Greenwood and Rasmussen will continue the dual tradition of broadly impacting science and practically helping conservation.  Advances in knowledge of olfaction in the endangered Asian elephant have proximate utility in practical deterrent development, thereby reducing human-elephant conflict.  Ultimately, how binding proteins interact with pheromones at the level of chirality will contribute fundamental insights into vertebrate olfaction.  In the broadest sense, this research will benefit human society by helping to preserve an extraordinary species that has interacted with man for thousands of years.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Articulatory representations are useful for automatic speech  recognition, speech production research, language therapy, and  language learning. Articulatory inversion is a hard problem because  different vocal tract shapes can produce the same acoustics, yet the  articulatory trajectory must obey the mechanical constraints of the  human vocal tract. Other examples of inversion problems over a  sequence, which share the multivalued nature of the mappings and the  existence of constraints, are: the recovery of facial gestures  associated with a speech utterance; the inverse kinematics of a robot  arm; and the recovery of 3D motion from video.    This project approaches articulatory inversion from a machine learning  standpoint, based on a framework introduced by the PI. The  low-dimensional manifold in articulatory-acoustic space is represented  in a probabilistic way by a density model estimated from data  (recorded using a microphone and electromagnetic articulography).

It is now well established that bacteria exhibit many social activities coordinated by complex inter- and intra-species cell-cell signaling systems commonly referred to as quorum sensing systems. However, understanding of how quorum sensing mediates social behavior is still incompletely understood, particularly in regard to signal dissemination. One fundamental aspect of signal dissemination is the movement of signals into the extracellular milieu by active or passive means. Once in the extracellular environment, bacteria use these signals to communicate with each other and coordinate their activities.    The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa serves as a model bacterium for studying bacterial cell-cell communication. Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa involves multiple signals including 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS). Dr. Whiteley recently discovered that PQS is packaged into P. aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles (MVs) and these MVs serve to disseminate this signal within a population. Not only is PQS packaged within MVs, but this molecule is also required for MV formation. There are three goals for this research project: i) elucidate the mechanism of MV formation in P. aeruginosa, ii) determine the role of MV-mediated signal dissemination in modulating P. aeruginosa group behavior in a biofilm, iii) examine the ubiquity of MV-signal packaging in prokaryotes.      As a broader impact of this study, Dr. Whiteley has established collaborations with Langston University to provide summer research opportunities for minority undergraduate students. Langston University is the only Historically Black College/University in Oklahoma. Each year 10-12 Langston students who are actively pursuing summer research opportunities cannot identify a laboratory to host them. Through collaborative efforts between Dr. Whiteley and Langston University, two Langston undergraduate students will be selected each summer for research in Dr. Whiteley's laboratory to participate on the proposed projects.      Over the last two decades, the field of bacterial communication has received significant attention, and it is clear that coordinating bacterial group behavior is an important and complex issue. The observation that bacteria mediate cell-cell signaling using MVs illustrates a novel mechanism for signal dissemination in a prokaryote and enhances the understanding of how prokaryotes coordinate group behavior. These results have important implications for communication biology as they significantly impact the quorum sensing paradigm of signal dissemination. This study will also provide minority students who are interested in pursuing graduate studies in the biological sciences with exposure to the most recent research in bacterial communication.      In summary, the ultimate goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to enhance our understanding of bacterial social behaviors through examination of the roles of PQS-mediated MV formation; 2) provide minority undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in microbiology and biochemistry with the opportunity to learn the kinds of skills necessary to develop testable hypotheses which will foster their natural curiosities.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This research seeks to understand coupling of the steps of gene expression through structural studies of the assembly of DNA-mRNA-protein complexes inside cells, using a novel blend of emerging nanotechnologies and molecular imaging methods.  Magnetic nanoparticles will be used to recover specific molecular assemblies directly from cells.  The composition of these assemblies will be probed with antibodies to specific proteins and with mass spectrometry.  The structure of the assemblies will be studied by electron microscopy.

At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is  eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute,  system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For  example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to  discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed  across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine  brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to  understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the  entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have  made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government  cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable  collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network  (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in  discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have  prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral  tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration  system.  This project will develop, deploy and assess social networking tools to enhance  collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The  proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and  public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on  the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The  researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and  envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the  substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer  Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.  Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social  network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of  digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of  the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks,  where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as  visual-analytic tools), or keywords/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development  and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes.  Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes  are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii)  different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii)  different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information  visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the  exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate  structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500)  one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to  multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.  Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among  large communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social  network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to  respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance Epidemiology Evaluation  Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide  spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed  research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately  generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support  collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond.  Further, the government and non-government partners in this project are exceptionally  well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and  outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use  of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have  the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the  public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary  perspectives) than heretofore possible. This extended network will also offer  opportunities for mentoring of previously disadvantaged members within these  communities.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The project is motivated by the fact that particulate black carbon (BC), which is treated equivalent to EC in the measurements, is a strong absorber of solar radiation, and thought to account for ~15-30% of global warming estimates, next only to greenhouse gases; however, the magnitude of this forcing on climate is highly uncertain. Aerosol BC has a residence time of about a week so it can travel thousands of kilometers before removal; thus its concentrations are dependent on the distance from emission sources. Reliable estimation of the radiative impacts in the U.S. from nearby and remote sources of BC depends critically on obtaining regionally representative measurements.     The PIs will determine the {EC} in filters collected every 6 h during summer and every 48 h during the winter of 1998 and 2002 at Whiteface Mt, and every 24 h at Mayville for the same years. In addition, {SO4} have already been determined, and real-time measurements of ozone are available for both the sites for the duration. Prior studies have shown EC and SO4 measurements from these two sites to be regionally representative and highly correlated with known import of upwind airmasses. The measurements will be used to evaluate METCHEM (METeteorology-CHEMistry), a model that dynamically couples the mesoscale meteorology of the Fifth Generation Penn State/National center for Atmospheric Sciences (NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) with algorithms for particulates and gas-phase species chemistry and transport simulated by the Multiscale Air Quality Simulation Platform (MAQSIP). The ultimate purpose is to simulate their radiative feedbacks to the atmospheric dynamics. Nested continental- to-regional- to-local-scale simulations over the observational sites will allow the PIs to examine the effects of long-range transport and grid refinement on the model predictions. The model sensitivity to emissions growth and control, and to successive improvements in the representation of sources such as wild fires and wind-blown dust will be examined using three different emission inventories in the input data.     The project will build upon, and augment current NSF-funded measurement and modeling projects being performed by both PIs. It will help evaluate a model used to predict the downwind burden and climate impacts of EC and other emissions from fossil fuel consumption. The evaluated model and the datasets it generates will provide tools of value to the scientific community in illuminating the impacts of these emissions on climate. The results from this project will be the basis for the Ph.D. dissertation of a student at SUNY, Albany, and participation by entry-level modelers at the University of North Carolina-Carolina Environmental Program will also foster training of new researchers.

Not all genes in a given cell are transcribed at once, and determining how and when RNA polymerase II transcribes a given gene (there are ~30,000 in humans and 6,000 in yeast) is an area of intense study. Understanding this process, known as gene regulation, is the key to understanding how cells become different from one another during embryonic development, how cells respond to their environment, and how organisms evolve. Errors in gene regulation by RNA polymerase II contribute to disease and changes in fitness (survival) of an organism.     This project is aimed at understanding one level of control of the RNA polymerase II complex. RNA polymerase is composed of many protein subunits, the largest of which is called Rpb1. Rpb1 carries out the enzymatic action in which RNA is synthesized during transcription of a gene. Many smaller subunits interact with Rpb1 at different stages of transcription to help direct Rpb1 to the correct DNA site at the start of the gene (initiation), to help Rpb1 travel along the length of the gene (elongation), and to signal Rpb1 to stop transcription at the end of the gene (termination). Determining when these subunits bind to Rpb1 is an important process that appears to be aided by an enzyme called Ess1. Ess1 is known as a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase. Ess1 binds to Rpb1 and is hypothesized to induce conformational changes (called cis/trans isomerizations) in Rpb1. In this way, Ess1 might control subunit binding to Rpb1, and thus help coordinate the multiple steps of transcription (initiation, elongation, termination) needed to generate mRNA and small RNAs. This research project is designed to determine exactly how Ess1 affects Rpb1, and thus how it may play a key role in gene regulation by the RNA polymerase II complex.    Broader impact of project: The research project will provide an opportunity for fulltime, intensive scientific training for a postdoctoral fellow and a Ph.D. student. Training will be in the various disciplines of genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. The project will also engage college undergraduate students during the summer months as part of the Department's Research Experience for Undergraduates Program (also sponsored by the National Science Foundation). Summer students will participate in ongoing experimental research during which time they will learn the scientific method, including the making of hypotheses, designing experiments to test them, carrying out the appropriate control experiments, as well as thoughtful analysis and interpretation of data. As such, the project should help inspire as well as train the next generation of biological researchers. In addition, the results of the project will be disseminated to the public in the form of research publications, presentations at national meetings, and free distribution of valuable reagents and scientific resources (data, strains, antibodies, etc.) to other qualified investigators.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Recent work has shown that nutritional deficiencies in early life can have consequences at older stages. Birds are unique models for examining the effects on fluid balance and nutrition supply during development as the egg is unaffected by maternal circulation. Using an avian model (Japanese quail) this study will test several hypotheses: 1) whether poor nutrition in early quail early ontogenetic stages retards the kidney development and/or impacts water channel expression/function of hatchlings and, 2) whether poor nutrition results in physiological malfunction in the adult such as loss of homeostasis (water balance). The PI will test the above hypotheses by measuring bird growth rate, plasma osmolality and electrolytes, conducting morphological analyses of kidney development and determining water channel expression/function using molecular biology techniques.  The proposed research involves several developmental stages and will use multidisciplinary approaches, which will aid in the education of several students in physiological and molecular techniques and how information obtained at the cellular level is interpreted at the organ/whole animal level.

Knowledge of the world is gained by exploring a complex surface with hands or a visual scene with eyes.  Yet relatively little is known about how neurons encode sensory stimuli in the context of natural patterns of sensing behavior, or about how sensory processing regions in the brain distinguish properties of the external world from the sensory consequences of the animal's own behavior.     A particularly clear example of active sensing is found in mormyrid electric fish. Electric fish use an electrical sense to navigate and find prey in the dark by probing the environment by emitting brief electric organ discharge (EOD) pulses. Nearby objects perturb the electric field around the fish, and these perturbations are detected by electroreceptors in the fish's skin.  Each receptor encodes changes in local field strength as small shifts in the precise timing of individual action potentials following the EOD. The fish thus obtains a sequence of ""snapshots"" of the world, in which information about surrounding objects is encoded in the timing of action potentials.     In nature, the frequency and regularity of this sequence of snapshots varies depending on the behavioral context, whether the fish is probing objects, foraging, or quietly resting. Interestingly, the frequency chosen by the fish has a clear effect on the timing of electroreceptor action potentials within each snapshot: higher rates shift spikes later, and lower rates shift spikes earlier. The size of these effects is comparable to the effects of small invertebrate prey on which these fish feed. How does the fish detect and capture prey when its own sensing behavior has such a strong effect on the sensory input?     This study provides opportunity to explore how sensory processing regions of the fish's brain resolves the ambiguity, and whether a change in the input from electroreceptors is due to an external stimulus or to the animal's own sensing behavior.  Neurons at the first stage of electrosensory processing integrate input from electroreceptors with signals from other areas of the fish's brain linked to the motor command that evokes the EOD. Such motor command signals could, in principal, ""undo"" the effects of EOD rate on electroreceptor input.     The research is expected to lead to a better understanding of how animals use internal knowledge of their actions to distinguish properties of the external world from the sensory consequences of their own behavior.  At a more cellular level, the experiements are also expected to lead to a better understanding of how information contained in the precise timing of action potentials is decoded or interpreted by neural circuits.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Gap junctions play important roles in development and cellular functions.  Mutations of gap junction proteins may cause a variety of diseases, including demyelination, deafness, female infertility, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias or malformation, embryonic lethality, and possibly cancer.  Gap junctions may be formed by connexins, innexins, and pannexins.  Although the three families of proteins are distinct in primary sequence, gap junctions formed by them share major structural and functional properties.  Gap junction proteins of the same family may self-assemble or co-assemble to form gap junctions, and get localized to specific subcellular domains.  Subunit-specific assembly and appropriate subcellular localization are critical to the function of gap junctions.  However, their mechanisms are poorly understood.  The aims of this proposal are to use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans body-wall muscle as a  model system to (1) identify gap junction proteins expressed, and evaluate their roles in electrical coupling and locomotion; (2) determine if the identified gap junction proteins self-assemble or co-assemble into gap junctions by coimmunostaining, labeling with distinct fluorescent proteins, and co-expression in Xenopus oocytes; and (3) isolate mutants showing subcellular mislocalization of a green fluorescent protein-tagged gap junction protein so that proteins mediating gap junction subcellular localization may be identified through analyses of the mutants in subsequent studies.

The proposed framework exploits and unifies three concepts: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, nonparametric kernel density estimation, and information theoretic optimality measures. Developed techniques will be illustrated in a brain interface, in which high dimensional spatiotemporal electroencelaphogram activity will be translated to intended commands for a robot. This interface will be designed to facilitate fusion with myoelectrically controlled neural prostheses.

Affiliation:  University of Connecticut Health Center  Proposal Title:  SGER: A two-phase fluid model of prokaryotic collective swimming      This proposal suggests the development of a two-phase fluid model to describe the  pseudo-turbulent behavior that arises in dense colonies of swimming bacteria. When large populations of bacteria collectively swim, many interesting fluid flows can be generated and these counter-flows produce feedback on the swimming behavior of the bacteria. Therefore,  studying the coupling between collective swimming of bacteria and the associated hydrodynamics will lead to a more complete understanding of colony development in  large populations of swimming micro-organisms, such as can arise during biofilm formation.  Recent experiments on dense populations of swimming Bacillus subtilis have revealed a volume fraction-dependent transition from random swimming to transient jet and vortex patterns in the bacteria/fluid mixture. This proposal will develop a model that treats the  swimming bacteria as one phase of a multi-phase fluid and the surrounding water as a  second-phase.     Intellectual merit: Even modest progress will greatly increase our understanding of  the multiphase fluid dynamics that arises in bacterial populations, which will have  consequences for other important areas of bacterial behavior such as biofilm formation.

In dynamic tasks, decision makers remain sub-optimal even with extended practice, unlimited time, and performance incentives -- but it is unclear why. We aim to improve our theoretical understanding of decision-making behavior in dynamic tasks: 1) how hypothesis are generated from cues in continually evolving situations and 2) how different feedback types change dynamic decision making behavior.    Hypotheses generation and feedback are important decision making mechanisms in multiple contexts, such as, 911 operators determining relative urgency to deploy resources, drivers trying to find the best route in heavy traffic, or military crews deciding how to respond to a threat. Our investigation will focus on medical decision making. An example of the kind of DDM situations we will investigate might concern a patient that exhibits symptoms of high blood sugar (e.g., blurred vision and reasoning disturbances). Tests indicate high blood sugar and low insulin (i.e., hyperglycemia). The physician's goal is to stabilize the patient's health. As the symptoms (cues) develop over time, the patient may be diagnosed with diabetes and given treatment, for example, to take insulin. Insulin often takes a moderate amount of time to have an effect. If the amount of insulin is not well calibrated to the amending physical state, it may result in too much insulin, low blood sugar, and a hypoglycemic crisis. At that point an exigent solution is required, such as to take some sugar by mouth or drink some orange juice which often would have a fast effect on the body. Ideally, a doctor should use the diagnostic hypothesis (i.e., type-I diabetes) and feedback about the patient's state to keep the system under control with correct dosages of insulin and/or sugar.    We will conduct this research using laboratory studies employing a DDM learning tool (MEDIC) and computational cognitive modeling using and extending architectures previously developed by our team. Laboratory studies will help us answer questions regarding hypothesis generation and feedback effects on human learning and performance in DDM. Computational cognitive models will propose representations of the cognitive processes and behaviors involved in learning and performance in DDM and will help us make predictions for follow-up experiments.

The highly reactive Mn oxide mineral phases scavenge numerous heavy metals, oxidize various toxic organic and inorganic compounds, and serve as electron acceptors for growth of anaerobic bacteria. In nature, most Mn oxides form through the activities of microorganisms, primarily bacteria. Studies of three phylogenetically-diverse Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria show that a homologous gene encoding a multicopper oxidase-like protein is required for Mn(II) oxidation. The direct link between those genes and enzymatic oxidation of Mn(II), however, has yet to be established. This project focuses on the mechanism, regulation and function of Mn(II) oxidation in Pseudomonas putida strain GB-1. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that Mn(II) oxidation proceeds via two sequential one-electron steps, both of which are enzymatically catalyzed. The recent discovery of a second multicopper oxidase gene required for Mn(II) oxidation in GB-1, in addition to the previously described cumA, suggests that two multicopper (Mn) oxidases drive this catalytic process. The new 5.9 Kb gene resembles the putative Mn oxidase gene, mnxG, from Bacillus SG-1 in its highly conserved copper binding sites. This project will determine whether each protein catalyzes one step of the two-electron oxidation, or alternatively, whether they work in concert to catalyze the overall reaction. Mutagenesis studies point to other factors that mediate Mn(II) oxidation, including interactions with c-type cytochromes, protein transport and location of the native enzymes. Physiological studies indicate that substrate-ligand binding and induction/ inhibition of oxidation by other metals, specifically Fe, play significant roles in Mn(II) oxidation. The results of this research will provide new insights into the reasons why bacteria oxidize manganese(II), broaden our understanding of biogeochemical cycles and the natural attenuation of toxic metals and organic compounds.

In the atmosphere, NOx plays a critically important role in the production of oxidants, such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH), through a photochemical cycle involving NO oxidation by peroxyl radicals and NO2 photolysis. NOx is removed from the atmosphere mainly through the reaction of NO2 with OH to form nitric acid (HNO3), which is considered to be photochemically unreactive and thus the end product of NOx. However, recent studies suggest that HNO3 can be converted back to NOx. Earlier work by this research group has suggested that HONO is a major product of HNO3 photolysis on surfaces, and may be the major intermediate in re-NOx-ification of the troposphere.    In this project, three hypotheses will be tested:  1. Organic compounds, such as light-absorbing aromatic compounds, may significantly enhance the HONO production rate from photolysis of HNO3 on surfaces and nitrate in aerosols, making HONO the major product of the photolytic process.  2. Photolysis of HNO3/nitrate on surfaces, including vegetation, is a dominant daytime HONO source and a re-NOx-ification pathway in the rural atmospheric boundary layer.  3.  Photolysis of particulate nitrate in aerosols is a major daytime HONO source and a re-  NOx-ification pathway in the troposphere above the boundary layer.   These questions will be addressed using laboratory, airborne, and ground-based measurements. The laboratory investigations will examine the effect of various types of organic compounds on the rate and product distribution of HNO3/nitrate photolysis on surfaces and the rate and product distribution of photolysis of particulate nitrate collected on filters from ambient air. Aircraft-based measurements will establish HONO vertical profiles over land (forest and farmland) and Lake Michigan to examine the transport of HONO from the ground into the overlying atmosphere and the in situ production of HONO in the free troposphere above the boundary layer. Ground-based field measurements will quantify daytime HONO fluxes from the canopy surface and investigate the relationships between the HONO flux with HNO3 deposition and solar UV intensity.   If the above hypotheses are supported by the results of this research, there will be significant implications for our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. A ""recycled"" source of NOx and HONO from photochemical re-NOx-ification of HNO3 on surfaces and of particulate nitrate in aerosols would cause the troposphere to be more photochemically reactive than previously realized, leading to higher production of photooxidants, such as ozone and OH radicals. This would be especially important in the boundary layer.    This study will provide training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students in atmospheric chemistry, and will establish and foster research and educational collaborations among the faculty and students at three academic institutions.

In oxic waters such as hydrothermal plumes, soluble Mn(II) is eventually oxidized to Mn(III/IV) oxides.  These ""scavengers of the sea"" (Goldberg 1954) are highly reactive minerals that are known to sequester a variety of metals and participate in redox reactions with a wide range of inorganic and organic compounds, thus playing an important role in marine geochemistry.  Bacteria catalyze the oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III/IV) at hydrothermal vents and other environments and are thus thought to be responsible for the formation of natural Mn(III/IV) oxide minerals.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in the circumstances under which stimuli presented in one sensory modality influence sensations in a different modality.

The use of introns is a double-edged sword for multicellular organisms.  While introns allow for complex regulation, generation of a large number of products from a limited number of genes, and facilitate emergence of new activities via exon shuffling, they also require complex processing that can lead to serious problems when it goes awry. The origins and functions of introns has been a subject of controversy for over a quarter century.  In this CAREER project, the PI and his students will create or improve several databases representing gene structures, and then begin to exploit them in collaboration with three laboratories that experimentally study non-coding RNA genes, gene expression, and alternative splicing. This project will thus integrate bioinformatics, bench research, and teaching.    The databases will include diverse information (location, sequence, signals, nucleotide composition, mutations, etc.) about millions of intron and exon sequences from species including unicellular eukaryotes, plants, invertebrates, non-mammalian vertebrates, and mammals. A user-friendly interface will allow a wide spectrum of queries concerning exon/intron gene structures.  Computer programs that extract and process data from the databases will be developed. One set of programs, based on a comparative genomics approach, will predict, characterize, classify, and catalog non-coding RNA genes and various functional elements inside introns.  Another set of programs will detect signals inside introns and exons that are important for precise splicing of primary RNA transcripts (pre-mRNA, etc.). Computer-predicted non-coding RNA genes of mammals will be experimentally verified using methods such as quantitative RT-PCR, northern blots, and large-scale hybridization with custom-generated spotted microarrays. Verification of predicted splicing motifs will be performed using two vector systems. One is the tau exon 9-11 model substrate from which a purine-rich exonic enhancer has been deleted. The second one is the caspase-2 exon 8-10 cassette from which an intronic suppressor has been removed.

One example involves the remarkable change in our understanding of prokaryotic contributions to global biogeochemical cycles, based on the discovery of ubiquitous and abundant mesophilic members of the division Crenarchaeota. This group was previously thought to be comprised exclusively of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea, but is now known to include a broad membership of mesophilic and low-temperature archaea living in non-extreme habitats. Currently, there is only one representative of this important group in pure culture: a marine isolate that fixes inorganic carbon into cellular biomass under aerobic conditions, using ammonia for energy. The ammonia oxidation process is the first step in microbially mediated nitrification, which links the mineralization of organic matter (formation of NH4+) to the recycling of N to the atmosphere (denitrification of NO3-). The metabolism of this isolate, together with results from environmental studies, suggest that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in archaea, rather than bacteria, may be responsible for the majority of nitrification in both marine and soil ecosystems. The diversity of habitats colonized by nonthermophilic crenarchaeotes and results from in situ metabolic studies suggest these organisms possess additional metabolic capabilities that may further impact elemental cycling on Earth. This project is a first step in understanding niche diversification in nonthermophilic crenarchaeotes. Fine-scale microbiological and geochemical analyses will be coupled with genome mining, gene expression studies and laboratory cultivation to test the hypothesis that aerobic chemoautotrophic ammonia oxidation is an important metabolic strategy for nonthermophilic crenarchaeotes in freshwater sediments, while also investigating the importance of a suite of other metabolic strategies for these archaea. This work is expected to broaden our understanding of the genomics and ecological properties of these enigmatic archaea in significant ways.    Situated at the crossroads of microbiology, genomics, ecology and geochemistry, the research in this project will involve students from high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in department- and university-wide efforts to forge new, interdisciplinary scientific partnerships. Three specific objectives will be addressed in the development of the education components of the project:  (i) Creation of an interdisciplinary graduate curriculum emphasizing molecules to global ecosystems; (ii) Development of an EBS degree program focused on interfaces between environmental systems and human health; and (iii) Integration of high school and undergraduate students into the research goals of the project. The development of the EBS graduate degree program (Objectives i and ii) will help Oregon to become a leader in cross-scale, interdisciplinary research on environmental systems and human health. Addressing the latter objective, a collaborative program for undergraduate research experience in genomics is proposed between OHSU and Pacific University, a 4-year undergraduate institution. The goals of this program are to provide undergraduates with hands-on experience in genomics through the annotation and analysis of emergent crenarchaeal genome sequence data.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides that repress translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in multi-cellular eukaryotes. The first miRNA, lin-4, was discovered in C. elegans by the Ambros lab in 1993. Since then, experimental and computational studies have discovered thousands of miRNAs in animals. Emerging evidence suggests a widespread impact of mammalian miRNAs on translational regulation. The reliable identification of miRNA targets is essential for fully understanding this new dimension of the complex gene regulatory networks. The objectives of this project include: 1) the development of novel statistical methods for genome-wide miRNA target identification in nematodes; 2) in vivo experimental testing in C. elegans for validation of predicted nematode targets; and 3) the development and maintenance of an online nematode miRNA target database. The methods developed here for nematodes are expected to serve as a foundation for developing improved methods for miRNA target prediction for human and other vertebrates via genome-specific modifications and extensions and experimental validation. The project will provide excellent opportunity for interdisciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows and computational scientists in the burgeoning field of computational biology.

Terrestrial ecosystem recovery following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction is best known from studies of the North American Western Interior.   This recovery is typified by the appearance of mammals whose lineages are unknown from North America in the preceding Late Cretaceous period.  That may be because knowledge of latest Cretaceous mammalian faunas has been geographically restricted to the northern region of the Western Interior.  In collecting this new, southern fauna, better establishing the age of the Naashoibito Member, and incorporating this new fauna in analyses of existing phylogenetic and biogeographic data bases, the investigators will advance understanding of how biogeographic factors preceding the most recent mass extinction contributed to the subsequent recovery of terrestrial ecosystems.

The objective of this research is to develop TTS technologies that focus on elimination of concatenation errors, and accurate speech modifications in the areas of coarticulation, degree of articulation, prosodic effects, and speaker characteristics. The investigators are exploring an asynchronous interpolation model (AIM), which promises to provide for high-quality and flexible TTS. The core idea of AIM is to represent a short region of speech as a composition of several types of features called streams.  Each stream is computed by asynchronous interpolation of basis vectors.  Each basis vector is associated with a particular phoneme, allophone, or more specialized unit. Thus, the speech region is described by the varying degrees of influence of several types of preceding and following acoustic features. Using AIM, the investigators are also developing methods to optimally compress the acoustic inventories of TTS systems, given a size or a quality constraint, and to adapt the system to a new voice, given a few training samples. The system being researched forms a hybrid between traditional concatenative and formant-based synthesis, having advantages of both, resulting in a high-quality, optimized TTS system with voice adaptation capabilities.

Unlike a viewer looking down from above, who would see the person as moving through a fixed environment, the moving person sees objects in the visual field expand as they are approached, or move off to the side as they are passed.  Using this flow to sense and control one's own movement might appear to be a difficult computational problem, and yet people still do it all the time.  The visual system does have help, though; in particular, the vestibular system, with its acceleration sensors in the inner ear, detects the directions of rotations and translations of the head independently of vision.  Having some redundancy between the two types of sensors is a good thing, because both are subject to errors, and because the two are effective at sensing different types of movements.  A major issue is to understand how the visual and vestibular senses work together in sensing and controlling the body's motion through the environment.  While each sense has been heavily studied on its own, how they fit together has received relatively little attention, at least for translational movement through a natural environment.    With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Douglas Hanes will begin to address the processes by which visual and vestibular signals together inform about self-motion.  The focus of his work will be on mathematically modeling the optimal integration of visual and vestibular information in the central nervous system.  It is known that visual signals associated with a rotation of the head?the global flow on the retina in a direction opposite to head or eye rotations?converge with vestibular signals for the same head rotation in movement centers of the brain.  Understanding a similar convergence for translational motion is harder, because the visual flow that results is much more complex, and successful modeling of this convergence will require the use of more sophisticated mathematical techniques. By elucidating the ways in which these senses complement one another, and by proposing a specific model of integration, the research will help bring together knowledge from independent research carried out on the visual and vestibular systems.  The results should shed light on vexing questions about how humans can estimate distances traveled or trajectories of motion with only one sense or the other, or what happens when the two senses conflict.

One answer to this central biological question is by ""ensemble coding"". This idea postulates that the brain operates like a light-matrix display. Each light bulb in the display is analogous to a single neuron and the brightness of a bulb is analogous to the electrical activity of that neuron. A display can express many messages, similarly, an ensemble neural code can express anything by specific and dynamic patterns of active and inactive neurons. No single neuron is essential for any message and each neuron participates in many messages. If the same bulbs in a display are used to express two messages at once, the overlapping patterns merge causing catastrophic information loss. In contrast, brains are good at expressing multiple, even conflicting ideas, but it is unknown how this is achieved. How the catastrophe is avoided when two messages are expressed in an ensemble code is being investigated electrophysiologically in this project, by recording from many neurons in the hippocampus of rats on a slowly-rotating disk. Conditions are arranged so that the rats must know where they are both on the rotating disk and in the stationary room. The activity of some neurons signals rotating-disk locations and the activity of other neurons signals stationary-room locations. Disk-coding and room-coding activity is rarely observed in the same recordings, indicating hippocampal activity is functionally grouped according to the two types of information. The project will determine whether this functional grouping occurs because disk-coding neurons are anatomically separated from room-coding neurons, or alternatively, because the activity of neurons in one functional group suppresses the activity of neurons in the other group. It will also be determined whether this functional grouping is learned, in a sense reflecting the organization of cognitive experience. The answers will help identify how the brain solves a fundamental challenge to the ensemble coding idea.

Rose and Amy E. Chew, co-PIs    ABSTRACT     In order to understand how climatic/environmental change influences faunal evolution, the PIs will analyze changes in the mammalian faunas of the early Eocene Willwood Formation in the central part of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. The record of fossil mammals from the central Bighorn Basin is ideal for this analysis as it is dense, extensively studied, continuously distributed and directly associated with a fine-scale climatic/environmental context. The Willwood Formation in this area includes at its base the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), a brief and abrupt episode of global warming, which is associated with one of the most dramatic turnover events in the history of Cenozoic mammals. Two other lesser turnover events recognized in this sequence appear to correspond to climatic shifts, but the evidence is equivocal. This project and other ongoing work should help to clarify these events.   The goal of the study is to assemble a high-resolution, densely sampled record of faunal change across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary and during the first 3my of the early Eocene in the central Bighorn Basin, especially targeting under-sampled intervals.  This will enable a comparison of successive samples from time-equal intervals, in order to evaluate patterns of species turnover, abundance, diversity, relative body size, and change in trophic structure during the early Eocene. The resulting comprehensive record of faunal change over time will be used to test the correlation between these faunal changes and climatic/environmental changes.  Of particular interest will be the effect on faunas of variation in the magnitude and direction of shifting temperature and of fluctuation in precipitation.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Unfortunately, in contrast to generative approaches, discriminative modeling is an exclusively supervised approach, requiring costly manually annotated training data.  Yet there is an important difference between language modeling and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that are modeled discriminatively. For other NLP tasks, sequences of words are the input, and some hidden structure is the output, e.g., parse trees; but for language modeling tasks, word sequences are the output given some input, such as a source language string being translated.  Large text resources that are not paired with an input of interest nevertheless provide examples of well-formed outputs, which would be 'correct' for any inputs that producing it.  The novel perspective in this exploratory proposal is recognizing this fundamental difference between typical NLP tasks, where there may be ample inputs but outputs must be manually annotated, from language modeling, where there are ample outputs with no corresponding input.  This project explores methods for simulating inputs for observed word sequences, and for using these simulated inputs with a particular MT system to produce a set of alternative (confusable) word sequences to the original observed sequence.  These sets of alternative sequences can then be used with conditional/discriminative estimation techniques, despite the fact that no supervision (manual translation of source strings) was required to produce the training data.",Corewell Health,Corewell,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Iron (Fe) is the fourth most abundant element, and the second most abundant redox-active element in Earth's crust, rendering it the most important environmental metal.  In recognition of this, a recent surge in research on microbial Fe redox transformations in the environment has resulted in many exciting discoveries and enhanced appreciation for the importance of these processes (Lovley 2000).  Most of these studies, however, have focused on the reductive Fe cycle and organisms such as the Geobacteraceae.  This is in part because Fe-oxidizing organisms, particularly those who inhabit circumneutral pH habitats, have been notoriously difficult to culture and study in the lab.  However, recent successes on this front have resulted in the isolation of a number of novel chemolithoautotrophic Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB).  Studies of these bacteria have revealed a remarkable diversity, both physiologically and phylogenetically.  This perhaps should not be surprising given that Fe is the most abundant lithoautotrophic energy source in Earth's crust, but is not in keeping with the present attention given to their study.  This project is initiating a microbial observatory for the study of iron-oxidizing bacteria (.FeMO.) at the Hawaiian Seamount, Loihi. The major purpose of the project is to elucidate the full physiological, phylogenetic, and biochemical diversity of this group of prokaryotes.  Loihi was selected as the study site because:  (1) FeOB have been recognized and studied there previously; (2) Loihi displays a wide-range of FeOB habitats:  from hydrothermal fluids to rocks, from low-flow, low-T (10C) seeps to high-flow, high-T (>60C) vents; (3) previous studies provided an excellent geochemical framework on which to base these studies; and (4) Loihi is very accessible, located only 25 miles SW of the big island of Hawaii. The research group represents a cross-section of expertise on FeOB.  Principal components of the FeMO project include (1) cultural analysis of FeOB, (2) kinetic studies on Fe-oxidation rates, (3) biochemical studies on the Fe oxidase, and (4) biogeochemical studies on colonization and solid rock utilization by FeOB.   Microbial Fe redox transformations are well known to impact environmental and human health, for example in organic contaminant degradation and via sorption of toxic radionucleotides, particularly in terrestrial and coastal marine habitats.  In the more poorly studied, oligotrophic deep-sea, chemoautotrophic FeOB have recently been recognized for their potentially important role in production of new biomass carbon.  This research is leading to significant advances in the study of FeOB and understanding their environmental activities and capabilities, and would enable more accurate predictions about them in many poorly-accessible habitats.     The FeMO PIs are involved heavily in middle and high-school teacher education and enhancement efforts at WHOI.  These include participation in existing summer workshops, the development of a new school-year weekend mini-workshop, and the direct involvement of a teacher in the FeMO fieldwork.  FeMO participants are also be strongly involved with higher education on multiple fronts, including the specific recruitment of female and minority undergraduates from a New England women's college (Smith) for summer internships via the Praxis program.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Pro-protein convertases sense the compartment-specific proton gradient through histidine pH sensors encoded within N-terminal intramolecular chaperone domains. This project will employ biochemical, structural, computational and cell biological approaches to (i) identify the structural determinants of these pH sensors, (ii) establish the mechanism by which the pH sensor functions in pro-protein convertases, and (iii) understand how sequence variations allow for differential regulation of pro-protein convertases.

To a first approximation, it exists in two forms:  as an unfolded, 10-nm-like filament, comprised of arrays of nucleosomes in a beads-on-a-string configuration, or as a compacted 30-nm-like fiber.  The former is characteristic of transcriptionally active euchromatin, while the latter is characteristic of silent chromatin (heterochromatin), which represses transcription in a regional rather than promoter-specific fashion.  How silent chromatin inhibits gene expression is not well understood, although the traditional view is that it does so by sterically hindering access of positive regulators of transcription to the underlying DNA.  In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, silent chromatin is formed by Silent Information Regulator (SIR) proteins.  Previous work has revealed, very unexpectedly, that silent chromatin is permissive to the binding of both gene-specific activators and general transcription factors (GTFs).  Indeed, an initiation-competent form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is present at hyperrepressed promoters.  By contrast, occupancy of downstream factors, including enzymes that cap the nascent mRNA and factors that facilitate Pol II elongation, is virtually abolished, resulting in Pol II stalling at the gene's 5' end.  How this differential accessibility is established is unknown, but is central to understanding the mechanism of transcriptional silencing.  In this project, two important issues concerning the fundamental mechanisms by which silent chromatin regulates gene transcription will be investigated:  1.  How do Sir proteins silence basal gene transcription?  This question will be addressed by (i) Testing the hypothesis that differential factor accessibility in silent chromatin reflects the temporal order of factor recruitment to a gene during the transcription cycle; (ii) Characterizing the role of key downstream factors in triggering silencing through mutational and functional analyses; and (iii) Evaluating the role of factor deacetylation in triggering silencing.  2.  How does gene activation take place in silent chromatin? This will be investigated by (i) Characterizing the dynamic alterations of nucleosomes during gene activation in silent chromatin; (ii) Determining the extent of spread of Sir proteins at transgenes subject to different degrees of silencing; and (iii) Comparing the coactivator requirements of euchromatic and heterochromatic genes.

In external-beam radiotherapy, beams of radiation are aimed into the patient's body from different angles.  The treatment planning process chooses the shapes, intensities, and angles of the beams such that the cancerous tumor receives a high dose of radiation, while critical organs and normal tissue adjacent to the tumor are spared, to the extent possible.  Radiation is not delivered in a single dose, but rather in fractionated daily doses over a period of up to 9 weeks.  The latest generation of radiation devices allows the delivery of highly optimized and accurate treatment plans.  This project uses the power of distributed computing and of advances in modeling and optimization to realize the full potential of these devices.  Advances are being made on two major fronts. First, the quality of the initial treatment plan is improved by using stochastic and nonlinear optimization methodology to construct formulations of the treatment planning problem that take uncertainty explicitly into account.  Second, imaging data gathered at each treatment session is used to perform adaptive radiotherapy, in which the treatment plan is adjusted between sessions to compensate for organ movement, tumor shrinkage, and other fractionation errors that occurred in previous treatment sessions.  Handling of huge data sets and large quantities of compute cycles is needed to perform the required calculations in real time---in part, while the patient is lying on the couch of the treatment device.    Forty percent of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy as a key part of their treatment regimen, and devices that deliver radiation treatments are becoming progressively more sophisticated and powerful.  This collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical physicists is improving the effectiveness of the treatment planning process by choosing the shapes and intensities of the radiation beams used during treatments to target the cancerous regions more accurately and avoid radiation damage to healthy tissues.  The optimization techniques being developed and implemented in the project also allow for day-to-day adjustment of the treatment plan, to account for changes in the internal organs and patient movement during treatment.  The key feature of the project is its use of advanced computing platforms in conjunction with optimization methods to improve the effectiveness of a vitally important medical procedure.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The project consists of three parts. The first part will use a linear, two-phase, steady state model for the depolymerization-driven motility of nematode sperm as a foundation for construction of a full nonlinear, moving boundary model that describes force generation and flow in these crawling cells. This model will include the permeability of the cell membrane to fluid flow, which is often neglected in models for cell motility. The second aim of the project is to do quantitative experiments to test specific predictions of the model. Using DIC microscopy and a cell tracking algorithm developed in the Wolgemuth lab, experiments will be done to explore how the speed of C. elegans sperm depends on shape and substrate adhesion. In addition, fluorescent beads embedded in elastic substrates will be used to measure the local traction forces generated by the cell. Particle Imaging Velocimetry techniques will be used to measure the cytoskeletal velocities inside the cell. The third aim will test the recently proposed hypothesis that cell blebbing (a process by which hydrostatic pressure differences drive the cytosolic fluid flow to rip the membrane away from the cytoskeleton) may provide some of the protrusive force at the leading edge of crawling cells. To test this hypothesis the PI will develop a new mathematical description of the behavior of the cytoskeleton and cytosol at the leading edge of the cell.

MSAs are widely used in computational biology for building finite-state models that capture long-distance dependencies in sequences (e.g., in RNA secondary structure).  Given a large set of functionally aligned sequences in MSA format, finite-state models can be constructed that allow for the efficient alignment of new sequences with the given MSA.  In natural language processing (NLP), only very rarely have MSA techniques been used, and then to characterize phonetic or semantic similarity.  This project is exploring the definition of a purely syntactic functional alignment between semantically unrelated strings from the same language, to define a structural MSA for constructing finite-state syntactic models.  The project has two specific aims. The first aim is to develop natural language sequence processing algorithms and models that can: a) define sequence alignments with respect to syntactic function; b) build structural MSAs based on defined functional alignments; c) derive finite-state models to efficiently align new sequences with the built MSA; and d) extract features from an alignment with the MSA for improved sequence modeling.

This experimental discovery contradicted the conceptual framework that has dominated since the work of Donald Hebb (1949), and requires different theoretical and computational tools.    Individual synaptic events have inherent random variability, so computational synaptic dynamics in the new paradigm must be based in the theory of stochastic processes. Previous work modeling the stochastic dynamics of neural systems uses approximation tools -- the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) -- known to be deeply flawed and potentially misleading.  The situation recalls the use of the FPE by machine learning theorists in the early to mid 1990s; indeed the dynamics of spike-timing-dependent plasticity in neural systems and those of stochastic approximation algorithms in the machine learning literature are very similar.    This project establishes rigorous tools for treating the stochastic dynamics of learning systems based on spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity.  It develops well-grounded approximation techniques (and exact solutions where available) and applies them to synaptic dynamics in natural and artificial learning systems.

By integrating experimental data with sophisticated, multi-scale mathematical and computational models, the potential for breakthroughs that will significantly further the understanding of tumor biology are great, thereby addressing a pressing national and global need.     Solid tumors are complex micro-structured materials, where the three-dimensional tissue architecture (morphology) and dynamics are coupled in complex, nonlinear ways to cellular characteristics and to molecular composition and structure of the growth environment. This close connection between the tumor morphology and the underlying cellular/molecular dynamics has fundamental scientific importance in that the cellular dynamics that give rise to various tumor morphologies also control its ability to invade the host tissue. This allows observable properties of the tumor, such as its morphology, to be used to both understand the underlying cellular physiology and predict the tumors invasion potential. In particular, the conjecture that diverse morphologic patterns of invasion observed during tumor growth are the quantitatively predictable result of molecular inhomogeneity (of both composition and structure) in the tumors growth environment will be tested. Because tumor cells use similar or identical migration and proliferation mechanisms as normal cells, and because of the multi-scale nature of these processes, the mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation that will be conducted in this project will also have application in understanding normal functional processes during development, wound-healing, stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration.

It is therefore not surprising that many pathogenic bacteria, including the opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, avidly pursue its capture and internalization in order to overcome the very low free-iron concentrations encountered in their mammalian hosts.  To capture heme, several pathogenic bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, deploy a heme acquisition system (Has), which consists of a protein secreted to the extracellular space (HasAp) and an outer membrane receptor (HasR).  HasAp is also termed a hemophore because it efficiently captures hemoglobin-heme and delivers it to the receptor for subsequent internalization.  The project aims to achieve fundamental molecular level understanding of the protein-protein interactions that allow HasAp to ""steal"" heme from human hemoglobin.  In particular, the investigators seek to gain structural, dynamic and mechanistic insights into the factors that determine the transfer of heme from human hemoglobin to HasAp.  This long-range goal will be reached by pursuing three main objectives: 1) Elucidate the three dimensional structure of apo-HasAp, 2) Identify the binding interface of the encounter complex that forms when HasAp binds to hemoglobin, prior to heme transfer, and decipher the role played by the gross reorganization of HasAp structural elements in the molecular recognition and binding to hemoglobin, and 3) Characterize the changes in coordination and spin state experienced by the heme-iron in the early stages of heme transfer from hemoglobin to HasAp.  The Moënne-Loccoz and Rivera laboratories have joined forces to meet the interdisciplinary demands of the proposed activities.  The Rivera lab will conduct the NMR spectroscopic studies aimed at solving the structure of HasAp devoid of heme, map the interface of the complex and study the dynamical properties of HasAp in the encounter complex. The Moënne-Loccoz lab will carry out the rapid-mix-quench experiments coupled to UV-vis, EPR and resonance Raman necessary to delineate the fate of the hemoglobin-heme as it is captured by HasAp.      Broader Impacts: In addition to providing molecular insight into the manner by which P. aeruginosa captures heme from hemoglobin to overcome the low iron concentrations in a mammalian host, the fundamental knowledge derived from these investigations may pave the way for the future design of inhibitors to the interactions between hemoglobin and HasAp.

Both forms of respiration require the ResD-ResE two-component signal transduction system. ResD, phosphorylated by ResE sensor kinase, activates transcription of genes required for aerobic and anaerobic respiration. This project will uncover the regulatory mechanisms by which B. subtilis commits to undergo anaerobic respiration. Two regulatory proteins NsrR and unphosphorylated ResD play critical roles in the decision-making process. NsrR is a Fe-S transcription regulator that represses anaerobic respiration genes but the repressor activity is eliminated in response to nitric oxide (NO) produced during nitrate respiration. This research determines how NO modifies the Fe-S cluster in NsrR and how this modification alters NsrR activity. Unphosphorylated ResD activates anaerobic respiration genes in response to oxygen limitation. Two hypotheses will be tested: One, that ResD itself activates transcription or, two, that an accessory factor interacting with ResD and/or the promoter DNA is responsible for transcriptional activation. To investigate these possibilities, mutations that affect unphosphorylated ResD-dependent activation will be isolated and characterized. The responses of microorganisms to oxygen limitation and to NO greatly impact the activities involved in the earth's nitrogen cycles and in pathogenesis.

Several key steps involved in gene regulation require chromatin remodeling, defined as the alteration of DNA-Histone contacts that comprise the basic building blocks of the genome. Recent advances have revealed that chromatin remodeling ""complexes"" that include multiple proteins are essential cofactors in initiating transcription on chromosomal templates during development, as well as the regulation of alternative splicing and epigenetic control of gene expression. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of the biochemical mechanism of chromatin remodeling, fundamental questions remain as to how chromatin remodeling complexes are targeted to certain genes in vivo and how they contribute mechanistically to both transcription activation and repression. This project explores the role of the Drosophila Brahma (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex in coordinating hormone signaling with gene regulation at developmentally appropriate time points through effects on transcript elongation by RNA Polymerase II--an exciting and unexpected role only recently discovered. The Drosophila SNR1 and BRM proteins are core components of the Brahma complex, which is highly conserved among all eukaryotes. This project uses unique genetic and biochemical tools in both fruitflies and cultured cell systems to unravel the functional relationships among complex components, including the ATPase subunit BRM and the critical regulatory subunit, SNR1. These analyses will help to define the mechanisms of in vivo target gene selection and regulation by chromatin remodeling complexes. The relationships between the Brahma complex and nuclear receptor coactivators that direct the hormone response pathway are also the focus of this investigation. While coactivator complexes have been identified in both insects and vertebrates and there are strong links between chromatin remodeling and coactivator function, the biological roles of individual components are poorly understood. This project focuses on a biological analysis of the cmi gene, encoding a conserved homolog of the N-terminal portion of the mammalian ALR1/MLL2 protein found as a component of several nuclear receptor coactivator complexes. Through the deployment of recently generated genetic tools this project will enable an unprecedented dissection of the normal functions of cmi. These analyses will provide an important model system to help understand coactivator functions in metazoan development and the relationship with chromatin remodeling. These studies using Drosophila as a genetic model system will provide greater understanding of the basic mechanisms by which chromatin remodeling complexes participate in programming gene expression during development, as the regulatory systems in flies and vertebrates are remarkably similar, including transcription control and nuclear receptor function. Thus, the results of this project should provide important insights to help biologists better understand chromatin remodeling functions as well as the regulation of RNA polymerase elongation in diverse systems.

The team brings together specialists in archaeology, protein chemistry, plant-lipid chemistry, and environmental biology to tackle what has been a sizeable hurdle in removing protein residues from archaeological cooking vessel fragments.  Unlike other classes of food resides (e.g., fats), proteins bind very tightly to clay during cooking.  This tight binding structure is, however, a blessing in disguise because it likely protects protein fragments from deterioration over time in archaeological sites.  The challenge has been breaking those tight bonds between minerals in pottery clays and residues.  Protein residues potentially provide a distinct scientific advantage to archaeologists over study of other food residues; proteins can be identified to species and tissue when they are preserved and removed from pottery (other residues offer only coarse resolution).  Importantly, addressing this methodological challenge will provide a new basis for asking wide ranging questions in archaeology both in terms of studying prehistoric subsistence (what people ate) and pottery function (what people used their pottery for).    There are several important implications of this research.  An ability to extract protein residues from pottery potentially enables researchers to study past subsistence and pottery function using a broader archaeological record.  In areas where faunal (animal bones) and botanical (seeds, nuts, pollen) remains are poorly preserved a common problem in archaeology pottery residues might provide a unique source of information on past diet and artifact function.  The technique can be applied to questions of agricultural origins, which is often associated with development of pottery in many parts of the world.      This research will be incorporated into a variety of educational settings, which includes exposure of under-represented cultural groups to this research.

Neuronal communication can be strengthened (called long term potentiation [LTP]) or weakened (called long term depression [LTD]) in response to experience-induced electrical activity in synapses.  LTP and LTD are manifestations of synaptic plasticity, the cellular correlate for learning and memory.  It is known that an enzyme called protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) needs to be inhibited by inhibitor-1 for the strengthening (LTP) to occur, while PP1 needs to be fully activated for the weakening (LTD) to occur.  Moreover, Dr. Xia has discovered that PP1 needs to be ""delivered"" to the right place in the synapse by the protein neurabin for its action.  The exact mechanism underlying the competition for PP1 by neurabin and inhibitor-1 in LTD and LTP is not known.     This project will test the hypothesis that the phosphorylation state of these proteins modulates their ability to interact with each other and function.  It characterizes the underlying mechanism controlling the strength of PP1 binding to inhibitor-1 and neurabin.  The project addresses a very important topic, that phosphatases and their interacting proteins may have a role in modulating synaptic transmission and LTD/LTP.  Dr. Xia will use multidisciplinary approaches - fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging technique, in combination with molecular biology/biochemistry and cellular electrophysiology techniques - to test his hypotheses.

Many of the most effective methods for cognitive assessment are mediated by observed behavior, particularly spoken language production.  These include clinical instruments, e.g., the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), but also less formal assessments involving interviews or dialogs with physicians or even friends and family. Behavioral changes noted through these spoken language interactions could indicate pathological changes associated with a disorder; or the changes may be transient, due to missing medication or depression at the time of assessment. Alternatively, the observed behavior may be simply due to normal change in spoken language due to aging, or even within the range of natural behavioral variation.  Understanding normal versus pathological language change with age requires the collection and annotation of repeated samples from both healthy and impaired individuals.  This project has three specific aims: 1) to collect and transcribe longitudinal spoken language sample data elicited in multiple ways from diverse elderly adults; 2) to develop algorithms for automatically extracting features from these spoken language samples; and 3) to characterize the variability of feature values across samples of the same individual; and the utility of feature values and even feature variances for discriminating between subject groups.

One in five women has been hurt by intimate partners in their lifetimes.  Among them, 42 percent receive injuries and 12 percent require medical care.  Despite the devastating impact that husband-to-wife abuse has on the wives and society, little is known about the day-to-day dynamics of this abuse.  The scientific understanding of patterns of husband-to-wife abuse centers around three long-established theories: The Cycle Theory of Violence, Family Systems Theory, and the Power and Control Wheel.  These three theories of violent behavior each predict different dynamic patterns with distinct implications for predictability and intervention.  The Cycle Theory of Violence asserts that violence occurs in three phases (tension-building, explosion, and then respite) which would yield cyclic or periodic patterns. Although the frequency of the periodicity may vary due to variable phase length, within each couple the periodicity would remain fairly constant.  Under the Systems Theory, the violence is dependent upon the feedback loops between victim and batterer.  The feedback, variable in strength and direction, may lead to chaotic patterns in violence.  Finally, in the Power And Control Wheel, the constant force of abuse produces constant stress in the relationship, occasionally erupting in violence.  Use of multiple associated strategies for control resembles the interdependent components with varying response predilection seen in critical systems under constant stress, leading to occasional random violent catastrophes of varying intensity--the dynamics of criticality.  To improve understanding of the dynamics of intimate partner violence, this study will document daily patterns of domestic violence as it happens, in the context of the changing environment surrounding that violence, and use dynamical modeling to tease apart the three theories and their predicted patterns.  The objectives for this basic theoretical study are to determine 1) the dynamics of intimate partner violence, 2) the personal, household, and relational context of violence, 3) determine the dynamical patterns of violence and degree of nonlinearity observed, 4) whether dynamic patterns of violence reflect underlying theoretical models that explain violence, and 5) the impact of study participation.  To achieve the objectives, this study will recruit 200 Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white adult women from six primary care clinics during routine office visits.  Women who report being abused within the past month but do not intend to leave the relationship will complete an interview at intake and a telephone survey every day for 90 days.  Questions will address the previous day's level of violence, arguments, hassles, distress, marital harmony, life events, and husband's and wife's alcohol intake. Weekly telephone discussions with the women and end-of-study interviews will assess additional relationship factors and women's sense of safety during the study.  Analysis will determine the specific dynamic pattern of violence seen as well as same-day and previous day(s) triggers of violent events.  This work will advance the scientific understanding of husband-to-wife abuse by identifying dynamic patterns and the processes that underlie these patterns, which in turn may enhance the predictability of these violent events and inform possible interventions.",Spectrum Health,Spectrum,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

Sensory systems process information by means of a complex neural circuitry. One of the major problems these systems must solve is how to identify 3-dimensional objects when sensory information about these objects is 2-dimensional, such as visual information from the retina. This research project investigates a special sensory processing system that is particularly suitable for answering questions about how complex objects are interpreted by a 2-dimensional sensory processing sheet. The system of interest is the electrosensory system of mormyrid weakly electric fish, in particular the lateral line lobe (ELL) in the hindbrain. Mormyrid fish employ an alternative sensory system during their nocturnal activity phase: active electrolocation. This allows the fish to detect and recognize 3-D objects in the absence of light.    This project will develop a stimulus apparatus that will provide the means to experimentally test the predictions of models that simulate neural activity in the 2-dimensional ELL. The stimulus apparatus will enable the exploration of new experimental questions of interactions between different locations on the skin serface. The model will extend previous studies of single cell activity to include interactions across the 2-dimensional sheet of neurons in the ELL. This modeling and engineering work will improve the coupling between theory, physiological experiment, and behavioral phenomenology.    The computational aim of this project is to model the spatiotemporal activity patterns in ELL that result from electrical images on the skin. Previous models of ELL will be extended to represent a sheet of interconnected neurons. The model will incorporate presently known anatomy and physiology of the system such as spike-timing dependent plasticity. This modeling project will advance understanding of how homeostatic synaptic learning can be controlled by the changing state of the sensory system.    The engineering aim of this project is to develop and distribute to the labs of collaborating experimenters a stimulus environment that will be able to present precisely-controlled spatial-temporal electrical images to the mormyrid electric fish. This electrosensory stimulus apparatus will overcome the limitations of current experimental paradigms, and thus help verify and challenge sensory processing models.

This process requires signals from certain types of harmless bacteria in the intestinal tract. The goal of this project is to understand how intestinal bacteria cause rabbit B cells (the cells that make antibodies) to make changes in their antibody genes. To achieve this goal, the investigators will identify the pathway that rabbit B cells follow as they move though the appendix, to determine when and where they interact with bacteria from the intestinal tract. In addition, the investigators will determine whether bacteria signal B cells to alter their antibody genes by binding to B cell receptors that recognize molecules that are widely shared by different types of bacteria. These studies will determine how harmless bacteria in the intestinal tract cause rabbit B cells to make changes in their antibody genes that result in antibodies that protect the rabbit from dangerous bacteria and viruses. The investigators' results will add to a growing body of knowledge showing that the bacteria living in the intestinal tract of animals are important for helping animals develop normally and protect themselves from infections.

Korelsky          Abstract   This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).     The researchers are developing new theoretical models and technology to automatically convert descriptive text into 3D scenes representing the text?s meaning. They do this via the Scenario-Based Lexical Knowledge Resource (SBLR), a resource they are creating from existing sources (PropBank, WordNet, FrameNet) and from automated mining of Wikipedia and other un-annotated text. In addition to predicate-argument structure and semantic roles, the SBLR includes necessary roles, typical role fillers, contextual elements, and activity poses which enables analysis of input sentences at a deep level and assembly of appropriate elements from libraries of 3D objects to depict the fuller scene implied by a sentence. For example, ?Terry ate breakfast? does not tell us where (kitchen, dining room, restaurant) or what he ate (cereal, doughnut, or rice, umeboshi, and natto). These elements must be supplied from knowledge about typical role fillers appropriate for the information that is specified in the input. Note that the SBLR has a component that varies by cultural context.     Textually-generated 3D scenes will have a profound, paradigm-shifting effect in human computer interaction, giving people unskilled in graphical design the ability to directly express intentions and constraints in natural language -- bypassing standard low-level direct-manipulation techniques. This research will open up the world of 3D scene creation to a much larger group of people and a much wider set of applications. In particular, the research will target middle-school age students who need to improve their communicative skills, including those whose first language is not English or who have learning difficulties: a field study in a New York after-school program will test whether use of the system can improve literacy skills. The technology also has the potential for interesting a more diverse population in computer science at an early age, as interactions with K-12 teachers have indicated.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The expression of affect in face-to-face situations requires the ability to generate a complex, coordinated, cross-modal affective signal, having gesture, facial expression, vocal prosody, and language content modalities.  This ability is compromised in neurological disorders such as Parkinson?s disease and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  The PI's long term goal is to build computer-based interactive, agent based systems for remediation of poor affect communication and diagnosis of the underlying neurological disorders based on analysis of affective signals.   A requirement for such systems is technology to detect atypical patterns in affective signals.  The objective of this project is to develop that technology.  Toward that end the PI will develop a play situation for eliciting affect, will collect audio-visual data from approximately 60 children between the ages of 4-7 years old, half of them with ASD and the other half constituting a control group of typically developing children.  The PI will label the data on relevant affective dimensions, will develop algorithms for the analysis of affective incongruity, and will then test the algorithms against the labeled data in order to determine their ability to differentiate between ASD and typical development.  While automatic methods for cross-modal recognition of discrete affect classes already have yielded promising results, automatic detection and quantification of atypical patterns in affective signals, and the ability to do so in semi-natural interactive situations, is unexplored territory.  The PI expects this research will lead to new methods for affect recognition based on facial affective features (with special emphasis on facial frontalization algorithms and on modeling of facial expressive dynamics), vocal affective features, and lexical affective features, as well as to new methods for automated measurement of cross-modal affective incongruity.    Broader Impacts:  The expression of affect in special populations is a largely neglected area in affective computing and robotics; yet, these populations may be among the most important beneficiaries of these technologies.  Affective expression impairments afflict many individuals, including those with neuro-developmental disorders such as autism, and those with neuro-degenerative disorders such as Parkinson?s disease.  Because these impairments concern a core aspect of human communication and, hence, may cause profound social isolation in these individuals, intervention is highly desirable.  However, one-on-one intervention by therapists, if effective, would be available only to relatively few individuals, thereby making computer-based intervention critical for broader access to such treatment.  Accurate processing of the affective signal will be of use as a research and diagnostic tool for a range of neurological disorders.  The CSLU research team will continue its tradition of disseminating research findings and technology, including speech corpora and software, to the research community.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will test the feasibility of increasing diesel fuel economy while reducing soot to below EPA emissions standards for diesel exhaust by adjusting fuel injection timing using feedback from an inexpensive soot sensor that can be placed in the exhaust path and replace the currently employed expensive and fuel inefficient soot filtering devices. It is proposed to reduce fuel consumption 2-5% by replacing the current expensive (~$3000) diesel soot filter system with an inexpensive (<$150) sensor & feedback system that will keep soot levels below EPA standards and increase fuel economy by adjusting fuel injection timing. The proposal will determine if the measurements from this sensor can be used to adjust fuel injection timing to reduce soot levels to below EPA standards while increasing engine performance, both of which are theoretically possible.     In addition to increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing diesel powered vehicle costs, the EPA will require the use of such sensors on all diesel vehicles starting in 2012. This sensor will be usable on all diesel engines, thus greatly reducing a major cause of pollutants in all major cities. In fact, the EPA estimates that 60,000 people die in the US each from airborne particulate matter pollutants.

Computationally efficient estimation of the error rates of hidden Markov model results    Hidden Markov models are employed in a wide variety of fields, including speech recognition, econometrics, computer vision, signal processing, cryptanalysis, and computational biology.  In speech recognition, hidden Markov models can be used to distinguish one word from another based upon the time series of certain qualities of a sound.  In finance, the models can be used to simulate the unknown transitions between low, medium, and high debt default regimes in time.  In computer vision they can be used to decode American Sign Language (ASL).  Hidden Markov models are used in computational biology to find similarity between sequences of nucleotides (DNA or RNA) or polypeptides (proteins) and to predict protein structure.    Hidden Markov models are employed because they permit the facile description and implementation of powerful statistical models and algorithms that are used to score a match possibility in sequence data.  Perhaps the most common use of hidden Markov models is for the purpose of hypothesis testing or classification.  For instance, a speech-recognition model may be used to quantify the belief that a recorded message contains the word ?elephant.?  However, once a score for a belief has been computed, the question is how to interpret that value.  1. Is the score strong enough to indicate a signal, or is it reasonably probable that noise will yield a score this strong?  2. Is the score weak enough to indicate noise, or is it reasonably probable that a signal will yield a score this weak?  The false positive rate (closely related to the type I error or p-value) for a score threshold is the probability that noise data will yield a score at least as strong as the threshold.  The false negative rate for a score threshold is the probability that signal data will fail to score at least as strong as the threshold.    In 2008, Newberg designed a method for estimating error rates that is more efficient than other approaches that are applicable to general hidden Markov models.  However the approach is still too slow for computationally intensive applications such as repeated searches of large DNA databases.  This proposed research aims to speed the estimation primarily via two approaches: (1) the creative re-use of simulations, and (2) statistically robust elimination of outlier simulation results.    The proposed research is significant because the facile availability of error rates permits researchers in a wide variety of scientific fields to evaluate the statistical significance of their conclusions and the power of their hypothesis tests. Once the technique and software are available, researchers in speech recognition or ASL recognition will be able to use rigorously derived statistical significance values to set their hypothesis test thresholds for word recognition. Financial modelers will have a rigorous standard by which to evaluate their market timing models. Computational biologists will have rigorous statistical significance values for their sequence alignments and for their pattern scans of large sequence databases. More generally, the availability of error rates for hidden Markov model results will significantly enhance the attractiveness of hidden Markov models for use in fields where hidden Markov models are not currently employed.",Beaumont Health,Beaumont,Beaumont & Corewell & Spectrum,3,True

The standard method in ASR for addressing variability due to phonemic context, or ?coarticulation,? requires a large amount of training data and is sensitive to differences between training and testing conditions.  Despite the effective use of stochastic models, current ASR systems are often unable to sufficiently account for the large degree of variability observed in speech.  In many cases, this variability is not due to random factors, but is due to predictable changes in the speech signal.  These factors are currently modeled in order to generate speech via TTS, but they are not yet modeled in order to recognize speech, largely because of non-local dependencies.  We apply the Asynchronous Interpolation Model (AIM) used in TTS to the task of speech recognition, by decomposing the speech signal into target vectors and weight trajectories, and then searching weight-trajectory and stochastic target-vector models for the highest-probability match to the input signal.     The goal of this research is improve the robustness of ASR to variability that is due to phonemic and lexical context.  This improvement will increase the use of ASR technology in automated information access by telephone, educational software, and universal access for individuals with visual, auditory, or speech-production challenges.  More effective models of coarticulation may increase our understanding of both human speech perception and speech production.

This research will reveal how the body of vertebrates responds to UVR stimuli and how the brain receives and further transmits information encoded by the electromagnetic energy of UVR absorbed by the skin. A broad biological impact will be represented by answering a fundamental biological question on the organization of stress response to the UVR fraction of solar light and its conservation at both peripheral (skin) and central (brain and endocrine system) levels. This will form a basis for further analyses on the evolution of the stress response system and the role of solar radiation in this process.

Cell crawling is integral to many important biological and biomedical processes, such as wound healing, cancer metastasis, and organism development.  A quantitatively predictive model that describes the bulk motion of many cells will have broad impact across many areas of biology and biophysics.  This research will combine the general physical features of single cell crawling with a physiologically realistic description of cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction in order to develop a mathematical model for the collective movements of cells in tissue.  Specifically, the model will address a number of experimentally-measured behaviors that occur in wound healing assays.  For example, recent experiments have shown that there are complex motions and long-range correlations of the movements of cells in epithelial monolayers.  In addition, during wound healing assays it is observed that the wound edge undergoes a fingering-like instability, and the average progression of the wound border expands at a supra-linear rate with respect to time.  This research will develop and test a continuum model for the collective migration of eukaryotic cells in tissue, with an emphasis toward explaining the dynamics of epithelial cell monolayers during wound closure.  Most of the model parameters will be set using existing experimental data; however, some parameters are currently unknown.  Therefore, comparison of the model with existing experimental data will allow us to set ranges on these unknown parameters and will suggest new experiments to test the predictions of the model. Analytic and numerical methods will be used to analyze the model for free boundary problems corresponding to two different wound closure experiments, and the model will be used to explore three-dimensional motility in bulk tissue.    To build an organism out of a vast number of cells requires coordination and the ability to move cells from one place to another.  Therefore, during development of an organism, it is not surprising that groups of cells often migrate together, as a semi-cohesive unit.  Similar migratory behavior is also seen during wound healing and cancer metastasis.  This project explores the physics of this motility and the mechanism by which the physical behavior of cells helps maintain the overall coordination of the group.  A mathematical model will be developed that takes into account the gross behavior of motile cells, considering the forces generated by an individual cell and the interactions between neighboring cells.  This model will be used to describe the behavior of a wounded layer of cells, and the predictions will be tested by comparing them to data from experiments that mimic wounded tissues.    The results from this project will provide a deeper understanding of many important biological processes, such as organism development, cancer metastasis, and even the motions of dense communities of swimming bacteria.

The cerebellum is a large part of the brain that is involved in sensory-motor control and motor learning as well as in cognition. Most scientists consider that motor learning is mediated at two separate sites, the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). All effects of the cerebellar cortex are mediated by Purkinje cell inhibition of DCN neurons. However, our understanding of how cells of the DCN integrate inhibitory input from Purkinje cells with excitatory input from other sources has been impeded by the large spatial separation between these two important cell types in mammals. This project focuses on a special system, the caudal cerebellar lobe of mormyrid fish, where these two cell types are close together. The proximity of these two cell types in the mormyrid cerebellum will allow the PI to record simultaneously from both cell types in an in vitro slice preparation.

Determination of synaptic dynamics and plasticity at this synapse will advance our understanding of the functional circuitry of the cerebellum.

The main objective of this project is to investigate the developmental role of a newly discovered class of membranous protrusions interconnecting blastomeres of early, cleavage-stage Xenopus laevis embryos. Time lapse confocal microscopy of live, surgically opened embryos expressing a membrane-tethered fluorescent protein unexpectedly reveals hundreds of extremely long, stable filopodia traversing the entire volume of the blastocoel, interconnecting blastomeres separated by as much as 300 microns. Most blastomeres appear to be simultaneously interconnected and in long-term contact with as many as half a dozen adjacent and nonadjacent cells via these long filopodia. These processes are filled with f-actin, and small membranous blebs translocate bidirectionally within them. Near the 512-cell stage, most of the long filopodia settle onto nearby blastomere surfaces and vesiculate, producing clusters of small membrane-bound, cytoplasm-bearing particles. The time of appearance and distribution of these remarkable structures suggest a direct role in early embryonic patterning, perhaps via the vectorial transport of maternal components or via blastomere-blastomere communication. The aims of this project are to explore this hypothesis by asking 1) whether the spatial pattern of traversing filopodia is biased with respect to the primary embryonic axes; 2) whether early perturbation of dorsal-ventral patterning alters their deployment or function.

Intellectual Merit:       DExD/H-box proteins are found in every living organism. They generally use the energy from hydrolyzing ATP to unwind double-stranded RNA or DNA to single strands in vitro.  They also share several properties including a common structure of their helicase core domains. However, for the vast majority of RNA-dependent DExD/H-box proteins, their mechanisms of action and physiological RNA target substrates are unknown.  This project focuses on Prp5, one of 8 DExD/H-box proteins required for pre-mRNA splicing within the spliceosome in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Prp5's ATP-dependent activities are important for monitoring the accuracy of splicing and essential for forming the prespliceosome, an intermediate in the assembly pathway leading to the active spliceosome that catalyzes splicing. In this project, a combination of genetic and biochemical assays will be used to test three hypotheses regarding Prp5's interactions with RNA. These three hypotheses address two critical issues fundamental to all RNA-dependent DExD/H-box proteins; how RNA binding regulates ATPase activity and identifying the target of an RNA helicase. The first hypothesis is that a region immediately adjacent to the helicase core regulates Prp5's ATPase activity by linking RNA binding to ATP hydrolysis. In vitro ATPase and RNA binding assays will be used to characterize kinetic parameters of RNA stimulation in proteins with mutations in this region. The second hypothesis is that RNA stimulation of Prp5 modulates splicing accuracy.  Mutant proteins defective in RNA stimulation of ATPase activity will be assessed for their effects on splicing accuracy in vivo.  The third hypothesis is that Prp5's helicase core binds U2 RNA (another spliceosomal factor), pre-mRNA or both within the spliceosome. Directed hydroxyl radical mapping and in vitro splicing assays will be used together to identify the RNA that binds the core and is therefore Prp5's target substrate.     Broader impact:       This research project will have several outcomes important to advancing science as well as  education and training.

The NSF funded research project conducted by Anne Sereno and Saumil Patel at the University of Houston will use human behavioral experiments and a mathematical model to examine the brain mechanisms underlying reflexive spatial attention in vision.  The information processing capability of the human central nervous system (CNS) is limited by factors such as the number of neurons available in the system as well as the way they are connected to each other. These limitations are overcome by mechanisms that either move and aim the sensory organs towards the source of relevant information in the environment (such as head and eye movements) or ""aim"" the CNS itself towards the relevant information arriving from these sensory organs (""covert"" attention).  It is well known that visual spatial attention can occur reflexively and automatically without conscious awareness.  However, the details of the neural circuitry involved in reflexive spatial attention are still largely unknown. Further, although much of what is known about the neural mechanisms of visual spatial attention has been learned from studying monkeys, there are few, if any, theoretical models that link neurophysiological data from monkeys to human behavioral data.  Sereno and Patel's research will begin to fill this gap by extending a physiologically plausible model of reflexive attention to analyze previously collected neural data from monkeys.  Recent work suggests that the parietal areas of the brain, previously thought to be largely devoted to spatial processing, and thus important for spatial attention, are also sensitive to stimulus shape.  Thus, an additional goal of this research is to determine the role that object shape plays in reflexive spatial attention.      Understanding the neural circuitry of reflexive spatial attention is an important step in linking sensory signals to perception and behavior.  This research will provide a theoretical framework for linking physiological data from monkeys to human behavioral data.  In particular, the work proposed here will yield insight into how the brain automatically filters information and guides behavior.

Intellectual merit:  This project will explore a new mechanism of gene regulation in mammalian cells.  Messenger RNAs that contain inverted repeats of sequences within them are susceptible to a process called RNA editing in the nucleus.  Editing results in the conversion of adenosines to inosines in the RNA backbone and is associated with inefficient export of these molecules to the cytoplasm.  In humans most mRNAs of this type appear to contain inverted repeats of short Alu elements, which are extremely abundant in the genome.  mRNAs that are edited at multiple sites can be bound by a nuclear protein complex that inhibits their export to the cytoplasm.  Such nuclear retention appears to provide a quality control mechanism that prevents inappropriate translation of altered RNAs.  The PI's laboratory has found that edited mRNAs accumulate in nuclear sub-compartments called paraspeckles.  Curiously, paraspeckles not only contain nuclear-retained mRNAs, but are also associated with an abundant nuclear-retained noncoding RNA, NEAT1.  Further experiments led to the discovery that NEAT1 RNA plays an essential role in both the assembly and function of paraspeckles.  This represents the first demonstration of a molecular function for a long noncoding RNA in specific gene regulation, paving the way for numerous follow-up studies that will help us to understand the mechanics of the nuclear retention quality control pathway.  Finally, the PI's research has uncovered a role for this pathway in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology, because it is lacking in hESCs but is induced upon differentiation.  Since hESCs are the only cells known so far to lack NEAT1 expression, this finding will be followed up experimentally in order to understand its unique significance in stem cell function.       Broader impacts:  The long-term goal of the project is to understand how dsRNA molecules are recognized and dealt with in mammalian cells, including embryonic stem cells.

Regulation of gene transcription is central to growth, development, and response to environment in all cells; thus, understanding transcriptional control is a central goal in genetics. The specific goals of this project are to gain new insight into chromatin remodeling during gene activation, and into the role of the Mediator complex in gene regulation. DNA in higher organisms, including humans, is packaged into nucleosomes by wrapping around an octamer of histone proteins.  This creates a potential impediment to protein-DNA interactions needed for transcription of DNA into RNA, and so at many genes these nucleosomes must be remodeled to allow transcription to occur.  This project will focus on chromatin remodeling at the CHA1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to examine the mechanism by which remodeling leads to histone eviction at CHA1 and at additional inducible promoters. Studies will also be conducted to investigate the role of the Mediator complex in transcriptional regulation in yeast.  Mediator is a large, multi-subunit complex, comprising tail, middle, and head modules that bridges activators, whose binding is the initial step in gene activation, and the general transcription machinery.  Mediator is highly conserved across the eukaryotic kingdom, and serves as a conduit for many regulatory signals, but the mechanism by which it controls gene expression is not well understood.  Research will be carried out to determine whether one specific part of the Mediator complex, called the tail module, has specific functions aside from its requirement for recruitment of the middle and head modules, and to determine the role of the tail module of Mediator in CHA1 activation, in genome-wide recruitment of Mediator, and in transcriptional repression.  Overall, this project will provide new information on fundamental aspects of transcriptional activation which at present is poorly understood.  Transcriptional mechanisms are well conserved across eukaryotes. Hence, the information gained from this work will be broadly applicable.    Broader impact    This research will include training of a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow.  In addition, undergraduates will be recruited to participate in this project as summer interns, to be funded by REU supplements.

Synaptic transmission involves release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic neuron terminals and capture by specific postsynaptic receptors that transit ions to alter the target cell's excitability.  Nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) bind ACh to mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia controlling homeostasis and modulating the output of brain circuits that control coordinated movement and behaviors underlying pleasure and reward.  Despite their broad relevance, the molecular mechanisms regulating function and development of nicotinic synapses remain poorly understood.  This project will explore changes triggered by a neuropeptide (PACAP) released from the pituitary at nicotinic synapses on autonomic ciliary ganglion (CG) neurons. Recent findings indicate that PACAP rapidly regulates synapses on CG neurons in culture. Electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify altered synaptic properties and determine the protein-protein interactions that mediate this regulation.  Since PACAP levels are developmentally regulated, and exogenous PACAP enhances neuronal survival in an activity dependent fashion, the possibility that PACAP persistently influences synapse formation and function will also be explored.  It is expected that PACAP-triggered signaling will be critical both for building nicotinic synapses and controlling their function.  Lastly, outreach programs administered through the University of Toledo will be used to train visiting undergraduates, high school students, and high school teachers.

Cells depend on cues that they receive from the external environment to grow, divide and survive.  Plant and animal (including human) cells have evolved complex pathways for recognizing and internalizing cargo molecules from the external milieu and shuttling the cargo to various subcellular locations for processing.  The pathways that govern the handling of internalized cargo are present in all cells except bacteria and are governed by evolutionarily conserved escort proteins.  These regulatory escort proteins function together as a molecular machine that must be dynamically assembled and dissassembled according to the cargo and its subcellular destination.  The objective of the research is to unravel how a subset of regulatory escort proteins in animal cells (Rab7 GTPase, MTMR13 lipid phosphatase, hVps39 nucleotide exchange factor and TBC1D15 GTPase activating protein) recognize one another and are assembled into a functional machine that appropriately delivers its cargo.  Failure of the machine components to work together leads to a failure of the cell to survive.  The research also develops novel chemical probes, which is applicable to the study of a family of small GTPases with >100 members.  The project combines state-of-the-art visualization of cellular processes; chemical biology and novel compound identification for pathway dissection; and quantitative biology for accurate measurement all with the goal of acquiring mechanistic understanding of escort proteins that are central to cell function and viability.     The broad impact of the project is increased scientific literacy and elucidation of processes that are fundamental to all cells; the manipulation of which may have technologic advantage.  The head of the program is an experienced mentor, expert in cell biology, biochemistry and advanced microscopic imaging and active in science education outreach to public and secondary school students.

The pathway and Rab7 GTPase being studied is also relevant in plants where it is related to plant growth, pollen production, fruit ripening and nitrogen fixation.

A language model (LM) is conventionally optimized, using text in the target language, to assign high probability to well-formed sentences.  This method has a fundamental shortcoming: the optimization does not explicitly target the kinds of distinctions necessary to accomplish the task at hand, such as discriminating (for ASR) between different words that are acoustically confusable or (for MT) between different target-language words that express the multiple meanings of a polysemous source-language word.    Discriminative optimization of the LM, which would overcome this shortcoming, requires large quantities of paired input-output sequences: speech and its reference transcription for ASR or source-language (e.g. Chinese) sentences and their translations into the target language (say, English) for MT.  Such resources are expensive, and limit the efficacy of discriminative training methods.    In a radical departure from convention, this project is investigating discriminative training using easily available, *unpaired* input and output sequences: un-transcribed speech or monolingual source-language text and unpaired target-language text.  Two key ideas are being pursued: (i) unlabeled input sequences (e.g. speech or Chinese text) are processed to learn likely confusions encountered by the ASR or MT system; (ii) unpaired output sequences (English text) are leveraged to discriminate between these well-formed sentences from the (supposed) ill-formed sentences the system could potentially confuse them with.

One fundamental feature of the central nervous system is that neuronal activity can modify the characteristics of the postsynaptic response. This use-dependent change in synaptic strength may alter information processing in a neuronal circuit and information storage within the brain.     One of the proposed mechanisms for synaptic plasticity is that AMPA-type glutamate receptors present in the postsynaptic membrane undergo dynamic changes in response to alterations in synaptic activity. Alterations in the number of AMPA receptors and in their phosphorylation state can change the amplitude of the synaptic current and thereby alter the postsynaptic response. Recent work by Dr. Liu and her colleague has shown that the repetitive synaptic activation of a subset of AMPA receptors that are permeable to Ca2+ results in the rapid appearance of Ca2+-impermeable synaptic AMPA receptors in a cerebellar interneuron, the stellate cell. This switch not only reduces the amplitude of the synaptic current, but also prolongs the decay time course of the synaptic current. Interestingly, the reversal of this process, changing from Ca2+-impermeable to Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, occurs after epileptic seizures. This change may be involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced neuronal death.    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Liu will study the physiological consequences of the activity-dependent switch in AMPA receptor subtypes. This investigation could further our understanding of how synaptic plasticity may alter input-output relationships within a cerebellar neuronal network that is essential for several forms of well characterized motor learning.

A key benefit of maintaining a CDW lies in its ability to provide the raw data that are needed for large-scale study of real-world health care -- for example, finding a previously unknown association between a pain killer (e.g., Vioxx) and heart disease. Unfortunately, CDWs are riddled with systematic errors that make it difficult to answer even the simplest questions (such as ""What fraction of female outpatients have breast cancer?"") with any accuracy.    This project focuses on statistical models and learning algorithms for quantifying and correcting errors in CDW records. For example, the project is developing semi-supervised learning methods that use the structured data present in electronic medical records (patient age, weight, medications, billing codes, etc.) in order to quantify the likelihood of error that is associated with the diagnosis codes present in the record (for example, being able to state ""There is a 0.2 probability that the correct code was migraine instead of the listed headache""). The project will also develop methods that attempt to control for confounding variables present in the records, in order to remove systematic biases from the data.

Since bacteria are asexual, their rapid acquisition of new genes (for things like antibiotic resistance or ability to degrade specific chemicals) depends on the huge amount of gene exchange between species. Despite its critical importance, what controls the rate of this gene flow between bacteria is poorly understood. But it does seem clear that restriction-modification (RM) systems play a key role. RM systems produce two enzymes, a nuclease that cuts unprotected DNA (such as what enters from another cell or a bacterial virus), and a methyltransferase that protects the bacterium's own DNA from the nuclease. Many basic questions about the functioning and roles of these systems remain. Given the great importance of RM systems for understanding ongoing bacterial evolution, with implications for everything from plant diseases through biogeochemistry and global warming, it is critical that this deficiency in our understanding be addressed.     The purpose of this project is to elucidate the regulatory design of a C protein-controlled model RM system, and how it acts in a living bacterial cell. The C protein activates transcription of its own gene, and of the downstream nuclease gene, and as a result nuclease expression is delayed until C protein accumulates. The first aim is to determine the range of acceptable relative levels of a paired nuclease and methyltransferase. If the methyltransferase/nuclease ratio is too low, cells may die from DNA damage. If this ratio is too high, the entire population may be killed by virus (phage) that escaped the nuclease and became methylated. The second aim determines naturally occurring changes in relative nuclease and methyltransferase levels, under a range of growth conditions including stresses. The third aim is to characterize the time sensitive control system that controls production of the nuclease. Mathematical modeling has provided predictions that will be tested, to see if the system design is accurately understood.

To behave adaptively, living beings must coordinate body and mind. However important questions remain as to how this may occur. First, is the direction of control exclusively mind or brain to body? For instance does the coordination of motor components in walking change the coordination of cognitive components in talking? Motor acts are commonly treated as consequent on or independent of cognitive activity (e.g., thinking proceeds apace, whether one sits or walks). But preliminary data of this research project corroborate that coordination of motor behavior has an impact on cognitive dynamics. Second, how do control and coordination of cognitive dynamics change across the lifespan? The dynamics of motor coordination has a linear progression, in which dynamic patterns change from a greater fractal dimension in childhood to a lesser fractal dimension in old age. Does the same hold for cognitive tasks? For instance, it is unclear whether cognitive coordination deteriorates with age.     With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Van Orden and his colleagues will substantially bridge these knowledge gaps as they investigate control and coordina-tion of cognitive and motor behavior across the life span.  Their empirical studies will contribute to two distinct areas. First, findings of interdependence of motor and cognitive components may overhaul the common view that cognition unfolds independently of the motor actions of the body. Second, findings on how control and coordination of cognitive activity changes as a function of age will broadly inform developmental theory, including theory that links behavioral changes to cortical organization in a child's or adult's brain. The project also includes the use of new non-linear methods of recurrence quantifica-tion analysis as tools for fractal analysis, which may circumvent problems of linear tools, supply a more detailed picture of fractal behavior, and add methodological rigor to the study of fractal phenomena in all fields that confront such phenomena.
