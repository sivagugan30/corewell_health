CRCWM\ncovers the west half of Michigan and cares for almost 16,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients and their families\nper year. Formed from two experienced Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs) in 2014, CRCWM has\na 50-year history of bringing cancer clinical trials and education to the community, continues to be a major\naccruer to National Cancer Institute (NCI) studies, and is acknowledged by the NCORP division as a high-\nperformance program.\nWith over 140 oncology physician investigators, 75 oncology nurse practitioners/ physician assistants, and a\nwell-established research operations team of 40 research nurses and coordinators, CRCWM has the ability to\nenroll patients with cancer related diagnoses across the continuum and to address NCI goals of expanding\nparticipation of underrepresented individuals in clinical trials. This application reiterates our commitment to high-\nquality research and ongoing alignment with the NCI Cancer Plan and initiatives.\nStrategic goals to meet this mission and vision include:\n1. To maximize accrual of patients to cancer clinical trials sponsored by the NCI including priority studies for\ntreatment, cancer control/prevention/screening, molecular/precision medicine, and imaging.\n2. To be strong contributors to Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR).\n3. To maximize the sharing of NCI scientific findings into clinical care through education and engagement of\nclinical partners and health systems.\n4. To contribute to better understanding of health care gaps experienced by individuals who may be\nunderrepresented (e.g., rural, adolescent/young adult, and elderly) within our communities.\n5. To optimize our contribution to the national scientific research agenda by expanding our leadership and\ncommittee participation in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)/NCORP research bases and the\nmentoring of young investigators.\nCRCWM is well-positioned to continue forward this next year with the scope of work demonstrated consistently\nthroughout this grant cycle and by our long history of experience and success.",
