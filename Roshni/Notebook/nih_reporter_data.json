            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\nExercise benefits the body in many ways. The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including \u201cbrowning\u201d of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via \u03b1v integrins, with \u03b1v\u03b25 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and \u03b1v\u03b25\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90\u03b1 binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b25, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), \u03b1v\u03b25 and Hsp90\u03b1. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing \u03b1v and \u03b25, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90\u03b1 will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce\u2019s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.",

Irisin was identified\nas an exercise-induced hormone that benefits multiple tissues/organs. Elucidating the molecular basis of irisin-\nmediated effects via its integrin receptor may reveal a novel mechanism of hormone-induced integrin signaling,\nand therapeutically, it will assist drug and antibody development to treat sedentary individuals to prevent disease\nprogression.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\nExercise benefits the body in many ways. The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including \u201cbrowning\u201d of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via \u03b1v integrins, with \u03b1v\u03b25 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and \u03b1v\u03b25\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90\u03b1 binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b25, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), \u03b1v\u03b25 and Hsp90\u03b1. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing \u03b1v and \u03b25, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90\u03b1 will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce\u2019s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.",

Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo. We hope that examining the role of macrophages pyroptosis against S. flexneri infection, will be highly significant and relevant for better understanding immunity and disease pathologies during Shigella infection and thereby providing the basis for developing novel safer, and more effective vaccines.",

            "abstract_text": "Shigella spp. are major enteric pathogens, causing acute diarrhea and bacillary dysentery leading to severe mortality and morbidity worldwide. Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo. We hope that examining the role of macrophages pyroptosis against S. flexneri infection, will be highly significant and relevant for better understanding immunity and disease pathologies during Shigella infection and thereby providing the basis for developing novel safer, and more effective vaccines.",

This will be achieved by developing and validating the\nDepression and Anxiety AI-COA\u2122, a machine learning-based drug development tool that\nanalyzes audiovisual recordings of clinical interviews to infer HAM-D and HAM-A scores, and\nthrough doing so enhances the effective reliability of primary endpoints.\nThe specific aims of this project will reduce uncertainties around the design and dimensioning of\na prospective confirmatory trial which will be proposed in the Qualification Plan (QP)\n1) Augment the pilot dataset: Assess 96 new participants to enhance the\n representativeness of the dataset, targeting 80% male and 82% non-white participants.\n Re-assess 30% of the new sample after 12 weeks to confirm sensitivity to change, and\n have each rating re-rated by two additional raters for enhanced reliability.\n2) Assess overall model performance change: Re-train the AI-COA\u2122 model with the\n augmented pilot dataset and evaluate the impact on performance. Adjust the assumed\n sample size based on the updated model's ICC to achieve the 95% CI around the\n expected ICC in the trial.\n3) Evaluate generalization across biological sex: a) Assess biological sex generalization\n using a non-linear regression model with fixed-effects, b) experiment with normalizing\n features between biological sexes, and c) develop mixed-effects models (e.g., Maximum\n Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian hierarchical models) with gender nesting. If the model\n generalizes well across biological sexes, loosen biological sex split and sample\n requirements for the Qualification Plan.\nRelevance to the Mission of the Agency: This project addresses the critical need for improved\nreliability and generalizability in mood disorder clinical trials, which have historically suffered\nfrom low FDA approval rates. By enhancing the quality of ClinROs, this research aligns with the\nFDA and HHS\u2019 missions to protect and promote public health and accelerate the development\nof effective, safe, and innovative therapeutics for mood disorders. The AI-COA\u2122 tool aims to\nincrease study power, reduce sample size requirements, and shorten trial durations, ultimately\ncontributing to more efficient and successful drug development processes.",

            "abstract_text": "Metformin is prescribed to 50 million Americans annually, and is currently in widespread perinatal (pre-pregnancy,\nduring pregnancy, and post-natal) clinical use. Over the past decade, clinical indications and pragmatic use of metformin\nhave steadily expanded beyond the treatment of overt diabetes outside of pregnancy, and now include prediabetes and\nobesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. With its expanded use, questions of\nunintended long-term harm have arisen. The rationale underlying these concerns for metformin exposure during\ndevelopment as a consequence of expanded maternal use arises from its basic pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of\naction, which we and others hypothesize converge to disrupt important metabolic pathways during fetal life, which are\nnecessary to establish normal birth weight and appropriate early post-natal growth trajectory. When combined with a\nmaternal Western-style diet (WSD), fetal metformin exposure leads to accelerated early development of a pre-diabetic,\npre-obese phenotype with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance in early adolescence (puberty onset).\n We are inspired by our preliminary data to pursue development of a non-human primate model of maternal\nmetformin use. Powered as a three-armed mechanistic-based clinical study, we will determine the impact of metformin\nor placebo exposure from pre-pregnancy through lactation on the development of obesity and insulin resistance. This\nstudy is adequately powered to test the hypothesis that maternal metformin use in isolation or in conjunction with a\nmaternal high fat diet renders low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, driving obesity and insulin resistance in\nthe offspring by onset of puberty (approximately 3-4 years of age). In Aim 1, we will determine if early life metformin\nexposure in control and/or WSD-fed dams leads to low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, resulting in obesity\nand insulin resistance in pubertal juvenile offspring. In Aim 2, we will determine what the impact of metformin exposure\nin WSD-fed dams is on maternal, fetal (G145) and juvenile (to puberty onset) metabolic physiology. This will include core\nmeasures of maternal and fetal organ metabolism (liver, muscle, gut and pancreas). In Aim 3, we will determine\nwhether weaning offspring onto a control diet can ameliorate or mitigate the effects of maternal metformin exposure in\nWSD-fed dams. Finally, in Aim 4 we will determine how early metformin exposure wields its molecular impact on control\nand WSD-induced alterations of core measures of maternal and fetal metabolism in the liver, gut, muscle, and pancreas.\n Considering the recently emerged epidemiologic evidence and known mechanisms of actions of metformin, there is\na rational concern that rather than preventing developmental programming, metformin use during pregnancy may\nhave unintended consequences of accelerating obesity and the metabolic syndrome epidemic in the next generation.\nThe animal, specimen, and uniformly generated multi\u2019omic data generated in the current proposal will collectively\ninform ongoing clinical trials and future clinical implementation.",

The current proposal will generate a Rhesus macaque\nmodel and robust data necessary and sufficient to understand if, what, whether and how early life exposure to\nmetformin (with and without maternal & post-weaning Western style diet feeding) renders offspring persistently\nsusceptible to obesity and insulin resistance.",

            "abstract_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort and adversely affect visual quality and\nquality of life. Many subtypes of DED are associated with ocular surface inflammation. Inflammation of the\nocular surface is mediated by both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Inflammation in DED can be\nassociated with ocular pain. Mixed DED (MDE) is characterized by decreased tear production (aqueous\ndeficient) and greater evaporation of the tear film (evaporative dry eye). MDE is often present in later stages\nof DED. DED amongst Veterans is common, and can be associated with a more severe symptom burden than\ncivilians. Veterans are at risk for developing MDE due to high rates of multiple medication use and co-morbid\nconditions, like glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Current treatment options are\nlimited and primarily palliative. Great opportunity exists to improve the quality of life of Veterans by\ndeveloping novel treatments for inflammation in DED. An area of the immune system that has been\nunderstudied and under-targeted by therapeutics in DED is the innate immune system. In particular Toll-like\nreceptor (TLR) signaling pathways may be over-active in DED. Histatin is a family of peptides found primarily\nin saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-bacterial properties. Little data exist on the\nmechanisms of action of histatin peptides. We have found that histatin peptides can improve the health of the\nocular surface under experimental conditions that mimic DED. Our long term objective is to develop a new\nclass of DED therapeutics that target the innate immune system to reduce ocular surface inflammation. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the damaging effects of an overactive innate\nimmune signaling in DED. We will utilize a well vetted model of MDE in order to show the efficacy of histatin\npeptides in treating DED. We will also undertake mechanistic studies to find the critical mediators of histatin\npeptide effects on innate immune pathways in ocular epithelia. The proposed research is innovative as it is the\nfirst study to investigate the use of histatin peptides as a treatment for innate immune over-activity in MDE.\nWe believe the results of these studies will yield significant progress in the development of new therapeutics\nthrough the use of rigorous and well defined methods and metrics in clinically relevant translational models of\ndisease.",

            "phr_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort, poor quality of vision and worsened\nquality of life. DED is more common among patients using multiple medications, including glaucoma\nmedications, and in patients with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. DED is more\ncommon among older people and women. As Veterans age and there are increasing numbers of female\nVeterans, DED has become increasingly important for VA to address. Moreover, Veterans with DED have risk\nfactors for worse outcomes and can have more severe symptoms than the general population. Many types of\nDED are associated with ocular surface inflammation and over-activity of the immune system, including\ncomponents of the innate immune system. This project will demonstrate the utility of histatin peptides as a\ntreatment for DED, and their ability to decrease damaging elements of the innate immune system. The results\nof this project will enhance healthcare for Veterans by creating a novel class of treatments for DED.",

Commonly used ophthalmic preservatives can cause a toxic epitheliopathy that\nresults in OSD. The treatment of these diseases is primarily through the use of palliative measures. Great\nopportunity exists to improve the quality of life of many patients by developing novel treatments. DED and OSD\nare associated with significant dysfunction of corneal epithelia and inflammatory changes on the ocular surface.\nMany of these changes are induced by hyperosmolarity, desiccation and inflammatory insults. Histatin is a family\nof peptides found primarily in saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-infective properties.\nLittle data exist on the mechanisms of action of histatin peptides, though some effects are thought to be\nmediated through as yet unknown receptors.

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal\ncosts. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform\nquantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early,\nless invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces\nwith pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for\n3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.\n Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as\ndeformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention\nand benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased\ndramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric\nepidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of\nthese conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor\nthe growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.\n To address this unmet clinical need, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable\npediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial\nmalformations. In the Phase I of this project, we will develop a novel technology to rapidly capture and analyze\n3D data of the top of cranium in just seconds. We will use machine learning methods to automatically compute\nthe head shape parameters, including the head circumference which is routinely performed during every child\nvisit, but currently with an outdated and unreliable measuring tape. Our technology will be designed for the\ngeneral cranial evaluation of all infants during well-child visits. In Phase II, we will develop methods for the 3D\nreconstruction and analysis of the full cranium from a smartphone. We will also train deep learning models to\nclassify types of craniosynostosis and other cranial conditions and conduct clinical evaluation and user-feasibility\nstudies.\n The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the\npoint-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in\ncombination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions\naccessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will\nlead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to\nlowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety.",

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal\ncosts. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform\nquantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early,\nless invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces\nwith pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for\n3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.\n Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as\ndeformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention\nand benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased\ndramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric\nepidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of\nthese conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor\nthe growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.\n To address this unmet clinical need, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable\npediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial\nmalformations. In the Phase I of this project, we will develop a novel technology to rapidly capture and analyze\n3D data of the top of cranium in just seconds. We will use machine learning methods to automatically compute\nthe head shape parameters, including the head circumference which is routinely performed during every child\nvisit, but currently with an outdated and unreliable measuring tape. Our technology will be designed for the\ngeneral cranial evaluation of all infants during well-child visits. In Phase II, we will develop methods for the 3D\nreconstruction and analysis of the full cranium from a smartphone. We will also train deep learning models to\nclassify types of craniosynostosis and other cranial conditions and conduct clinical evaluation and user-feasibility\nstudies.\n The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the\npoint-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in\ncombination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions\naccessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will\nlead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to\nlowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety.",

            "abstract_text": "Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section\n\nDelayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal costs. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early, less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for 3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.  Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.\n\nTo address this unmet clinical need, under our parent grant, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial malformations. The proposed supplement project will perform market research for the direct to consumer (parents of newborns) as well as business to business (primary pediatric clinics) path for SoftSpot, development of financial projections (pro forma), running a pilot with a channel partner, finding the strategic partners, and improving the product (both technically and regulatory wise) to be ready for launch and scaling.  \n\nThe overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the point-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in combination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions accessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will lead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to lowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety.",

By targeting\nrural counties in a Midwest state, our research team seeks to address the national opioid crisis at its epicenter.\nWe will also focus on a population among those at greatest risk for opioid-related harms: youth involved in the\njuvenile justice system (YJJ). Among arrested youth, 78% have recently used illicit substances. Our research\nhas shown that YJJ die at 1.5 times the rate of youth who have never been arrested, and a leading cause of\nYJJ death is drug overdose. The primary goal of our proposed project, Alliances to Disseminate Addiction\nPrevention and Treatment (ADAPT), is to address barriers to effective SUDs treatment of YJJ as identified by\nthe substance use care cascade. We will accomplish our goal by creating a Learning Health (LHS) alliance\nbetween the juvenile justice system (JJ) and community mental health centers (CMHCs) in 8 rural Indiana\ncounties. These collaborative JJ-CMHC partnerships will facilitate SUD risk identification and service\nconnection by JJ and enable timely initiation and engagement in evidence-based SUD treatment provided by\nCMHCs. We have employed a LHS alliance model to develop alliances between JJ and CMHCs. We have\nmaximized opioid use prevention efforts by implementing a bundled treatment approach to improve screening,\nresource allocation, workforce development and evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that target a range of\nSUD risk levels. We hypothesize that ADAPT \u2013 a combination of the LHS alliances and dissemination of\ntargeted SUD EBIs \u2013 will positively affect SUD and recidivism outcomes over time. We will begin our\nevaluation of this intervention. Thus, the goal of this supplement is to gather cost data on the LHS and EBI\nexpansion. We will be evaluating the benefit of ADAPT by completing the main aims of this project. By\ngathering cost data, we will also be able to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this model and evaluate the\nimplementation costs. We will utilize our expertise in implementation science, community-based research,\nclinical trials, cost-effectiveness research, and linking administrative databases, for research to assess the\nimpact of these interventions on criminal recidivism and substance use outcomes, including transition to opiate\nuse disorders and opiate overdose. By incorporating cost effectiveness and implementation models into this\nwork, we will be well poised to sustain this intervention and expand it to additional jurisdictions.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIndiana ranks 14th nationally in drug overdose deaths and, from 2016 to 2017, experienced the 3rd largest\nincrease (22.5%) in overdose deaths. The CDC recently reported Indiana as one of only six states with a\nsignificant increase in emergency department visits for suspected opioid overdose. Yet, Hoosiers at risk for\nopioid misuse and other substance use disorders (SUDs) are unlikely to receive necessary services; Indiana -\na largely rural state - ranks 46th in number of behavioral health treatment providers per individuals suffering\naddictions. By targeting rural counties in a Midwest state, our research team seeks to address the national\nopioid crisis at its epicenter. We will also focus on a population among those at greatest risk for opioid-related\nharms: youth involved in the juvenile justice system (YJJ). Among arrested youth, 78% have recently used illicit\nsubstances. Our research has shown that YJJ die at 1.5 times the rate of youth who have never been arrested,\nand a leading cause of YJJ death is drug overdose. The primary goal of our proposed project, Alliances to\nDisseminate Addiction Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), is to address barriers to effective SUDs treatment\nof YJJ as identified by the substance use care cascade. We will accomplish our goal by creating alliances\nbetween the juvenile justice system (JJ) and community mental health centers (CMHCs) in 10 rural Indiana\ncounties. These collaborative JJ-CMHC partnerships will facilitate SUD risk identification and service\nconnection by JJ and enable timely initiation and engagement in evidence-based SUD treatment provided by\nCMHCs. ADAPT takes a two-pronged approach. First, we will employ a Learning Health System (LHS) model\nto develop alliances between JJ and CMHCs. Second, we will maximize opioid use prevention efforts by\nimplementing a bundled treatment approach to improve screening, resource allocation, workforce development\nand evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that target a range of SUD risk levels. We hypothesize that ADAPT \u2013\na combination of the LHS alliances and dissemination of targeted SUD EBIs \u2013 will positively affect SUD and\nrecidivism outcomes over time. We will conduct a hybrid type II comparative effectiveness, cluster randomized\nclinical trial to compare the LHS to the EBI interventions. In addition, we will employ sophisticated\nmethodology, such as a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, and leverage our\nexpertise in linking administrative data from multiple health and justice systems, to assess these outcomes. We\nwill utilize our expertise in implementation science, community-based research, clinical trials, cost-\neffectiveness research, and linking administrative databases, for research to assess the impact of these\ninterventions on criminal recidivism and substance use outcomes, including transition to opiate use disorders\nand opiate overdose. We expect this project will guide future community-based efforts targeting the substance\nuse care cascade among vulnerable populations.",

            "abstract_text": "This study is part of the NIH\u2019s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to address the national opioid public health crisis and improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction.\nThis project seeks to address the overdose epidemic by working with overdose fatality review (OFR) teams. Current OFR practices rely on the case review model to make policy and programmatic recommendations. However, the continued rise in overdose rates and sheer number of preventable overdose deaths suggest a need to shift OFR teams away from case review and toward using timely population-level data to better inform their recommendations and actions. The goal of our proposed project, Fatal Overdose Review Teams \u2013 Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS), is to improve standard OFR practices by equipping OFRs with a data dashboard built on real-time aggregate data, record-linked across multiple sources and presented in a way that helps identify and visualize common \u201coverdose touchpoints,\u201d or opportunities to deliver harm-reduction services or engage individuals at risk for overdose in evidence-based treatment. Aligning with the goals of the HEAL Data2Action Program, the FORTRESS research team will leverage available resources and expertise to help OFRs translate data to action. During the R61 Phase, the research team will strengthen established cross-sector partnerships with two state agencies, the Indiana Department of Health and the Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH), which provide the necessary statewide data infrastructure to record-link population-level administrative data from multiple sources. MPH has also successfully developed publicly accessible data dashboards. The FORTRESS team will build on the early successes of MPH to ensure more timely collection of overdose event data and design the \u201cOverdose Touchpoints Dashboard\u201d (Aim 1). Our team will train OFR team members in Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) to effectively use the dashboard. The FORTRESS team also includes individuals involved in developing the CDC\u2019s OFR best practice guidelines and a pilot study of OFR adherence to these guidelines, which will inform our team\u2019s development of an \u201cOFR Fidelity Tool\u201d (Aim 2). This tool will be the first of its kind. For the R33 phase, we will conduct a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial comparing the impact of our intervention (dashboard + DDDM training) versus standard OFR practices on both implementation (Aim 3) and effectiveness outcomes (Aim 4). Implementation outcomes include implementation\nprocess fidelity (Stages of Implementation Completion), staff acceptance of harm reduction philosophies (qualitative interviews), OFR fidelity to CDC best practices (FORTRESS OFR Fidelity Tool), and usability of the Overdose Touchpoint Dashboard, (Systems Usability Scale). A statewide OFR data repository serves as a rich source of data on effectiveness outcomes, including OFR team recommendation quality and local actions to implement recommended overdose prevention strategies. We will also survey OFR team members to assess changes in their attitudes toward evidence-based overdose prevention strategies. In sum, the FORTRESS team is uniquely qualified to help OFRs use more comprehensive, available data to inform quality, action-oriented recommendations to reduce overdose.",

Thus,\nwe will provide OFRs with a real time overdose-related dashboard and data-driven decision making training.\nWe anticipate that our proposed intervention will lead to better quality, actionable OFR recommendations;\nincreased OFR actions to implement evidence-based overdose strategies based on dashboard data; and long\nterm reductions in both fatal and nonfatal overdoses.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nLewy body disorders, a subset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related disorders (ADRDs), are the second most\ncommon neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and the 14th leading cause of death in the United States.\nLewy body ADRDs are progressive, incurable, and mortality rates are rising, making end-of-life (EoL) care a\nsignificant public health concern. The majority of persons with Lewy body ADRDs are hospitalized in their last\n6 months of life with high rates of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital death, and low rates of discharge to\nhospice care. Because these markers of poor care quality are often incongruent with patient care preferences,\nurgent interventions are needed to improve EoL care quality in acute care hospitals. Despite this critical need,\nthere are two fundamental knowledge gaps in developing inpatient EoL interventions for persons with Lewy\nbody ADRDs: 1) lack of a prognostic model to determine risk of 6-month mortality and 2) lack of a validated\ntool to measure EoL care quality. This proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for\nDr. Whitley Aamodt, a movement disorders specialist, neurodegenerative neurologist, and clinical researcher\nat the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this project is to improve prognostication and EoL\ncare quality for hospitalized persons with Lewy body ADRDs by identifying patients at the greatest risk of death\nand ensuring that hospital-based care is appropriate and aligned with care preferences. In Aim 1, Dr. Aamodt\nwill use comprehensive Medicare data to develop a risk-prediction model for 6-month all-cause mortality in a\nnationally representative sample of hospitalized patients with Lewy body ADRDs using advanced predictive\nmodeling. This model will be externally validated in a second cohort of Medicare beneficiaries from the post-\npandemic period. In Aim 2, Dr. Aamodt will create, test, and externally validate a patient-centered EoL care\nquality instrument based on data gathered from diverse Lewy body ADRD patients, care partners, and\npractitioners using qualitative research methods and factor analysis. In executing these aims, Dr. Aamodt will\nobtain additional training in neuroepidemiology, biostatistics, and qualitative research under the guidance of\nmentors and advisors in epidemiologic research methods (John Farrar, MD, PhD), neurodegenerative disease\nepidemiology and health services research (Allison Willis, MD, MS), predictive modeling (Warren Bilker, PhD),\nqualitative research methods (Katharine Rendle, PhD, MPH), and palliative care research (Scott Halpern, MD,\nPhD). The results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about hospitalized patients with Lewy\nbody ADRDs nearing EoL and will guide the development of future interventions to improve EoL care quality.\nThis work aligns with the strategic goal of the National Institute on Aging to address EoL care needs in ADRDs.\nThrough the research training and mentorship gained during this career development award, Dr. Aamodt will\nestablish herself as an independent investigator in the field of applied epidemiology, outcomes research, and\npalliative and EoL care for aging Americans with neurodegenerative diseases.",

Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD)\nis a common voice disorder that often results in difficulty communicating in daily life. Many people experience\nvoice symptoms from speaking in noisy environments; for most, the symptoms resolve quickly. However, for\nthose with MTD, voice symptoms often persist, making it difficult for them to meet their occupational and social\nvocal demands. The reasons for this persistence are unknown. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the\nunderlying mechanisms of voice production in noisy environments to optimize and individualize voice\nassessment and treatment for these individuals with MTD. Most speakers increase their vocal intensity while\nspeaking in noisy environments, a phenomenon known as the Lombard effect. Speaking during and after\nexposure to a loud environment presumably requires monitoring of both background noise and one\u2019s own voice,\nand then responding with vocal motor adjustments. This implies that sensorimotor integration is crucial in these\nreal-life circumstances. There is preliminary evidence that individuals with MTD have atypical auditory-motor\nintegration and an atypical persistence of Lombard responses after speaking in noise. However, no known\nstudies have comprehensively characterized the underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant voice changes\nof the Lombard effect for those with and without MTD. To develop evidenced-based diagnostics and targeted\nvoice treatments, we must better understand the processes and voice changes associated with speaking in daily\nlife. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to 1) investigate the sensorimotor mechanisms of the Lombard\neffect and 2) characterize clinically relevant voice changes associated with the Lombard effect for individuals\nwith and without MTD within a communicative context. Sixty speakers (30 with MTD and 30 without) will complete\na Lombard task to measure vocal responses and self-reported vocal effort while communicating during and after\nexposure to a noisy environment. Inexperienced listeners will rate overall severity of dysphonia for the speakers\u2019\nspeech samples from the Lombard task. Lombard responses will be analyzed behaviorally and neuro-\ncomputationally, and they will be compared between the groups and across various stages of the Lombard task.\nClinically relevant vocal measures (i.e., acoustic, self-reported vocal effort, and listener-auditory perceptual\nratings of overall severity of dysphonia) of the Lombard task will be compared across groups and phases of the\nexperimental task. This project is theoretically and clinically significant; it will fill in a substantial gap, providing\ntheoretical insight into the sensorimotor mechanisms of MTD in real-life environmental contexts, and contributing\nto the clinical evidence to improve diagnostics and individualize treatment for those with sensorimotor deficits\nunderlying their voice disorders.",

Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in\naround 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and\npsychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.\nThere is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic\ntrauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.\n The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions\nand engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the\nendogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of\nemotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative\nsensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks\npost trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test\nthe feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people\nwho endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6\nmonths post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by\ntargeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma\nsurvivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility\nof delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.\n Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University\n(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides\nunique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central\nsensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed\nin JHU's rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,\ndidactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of\ncentral sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,\nand analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research.

Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in\naround 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and\npsychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.\nThere is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic\ntrauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.\n The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions\nand engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the\nendogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of\nemotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative\nsensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks\npost trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test\nthe feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people\nwho endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6\nmonths post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by\ntargeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma\nsurvivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility\nof delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.\n Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University\n(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides\nunique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central\nsensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed\nin JHU's rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,\ndidactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of\ncentral sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,\nand analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research. The completion of this K23\nproposal will provide the necessary training and preliminary data for the PI to obtain independent grant funding\nand systematically pursue a line of research to improve outcomes for survivors of orthopedic trauma.",

Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in\naround 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and\npsychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.\nThere is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic\ntrauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.\n The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one\u2019s emotions\nand engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the\nendogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of\nemotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative\nsensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks\npost trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test\nthe feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people\nwho endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6\nmonths post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by\ntargeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma\nsurvivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility\nof delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.\n Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University\n(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides\nunique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central\nsensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed\nin JHU\u2019s rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,\ndidactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of\ncentral sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,\nand analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research. The completion of this K23\nproposal will provide the necessary training and preliminary data for the PI to obtain independent grant funding\nand systematically pursue a line of research to improve outcomes for survivors of orthopedic trauma.",

Of note, the Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing (NLP)\ntechnology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. Within community service\nsystems caring for children with mental health needs, the assessment of team effectiveness\u2014although crucial\nfor improving team functioning\u2014can be a laborious and cumbersome task. Innovations in technology related to\nthe automatic capturing of communication between team members can lessen the burden in assessing and\nimproving team effectiveness. The Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing\ntechnology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. The Methods Core\ninvestigators have already been collaborating closely with the Administrative Core, the R01, and the R34 teams,\nand Community Service System Workgroup stakeholders in selecting, adapting and shaping strategies and\napproaches to implementation and improvement for children\u2019s mental health across service system settings. The\nMethods Core is a team effort led by Drs. Aarons (implementation science, mental health), Burke (team\neffectiveness, team strategies), and Sklar (mental health services, evaluation) (see biosketches). The Methods\nCore is organized to address four aims: Aim 1) Integrate models and strategies from team effectiveness research\nand implementation science to improve children\u2019s mental health services, Aim 2) Apply multilevel and advanced\nmethods and designs for team-based implementation research, and Aim 3) Lead the design and implementation\nof a multi-level, longitudinal, iterative evaluation to refine the Center\u2019s research activities, maximize the Center\u2019s\nimpact and inform plans for future collaborative research.",

This proposed project is consistent with NIDA\u2019s Priority Focus Area\n\u201cStrategies to improve the effective and sustainable implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment\ninterventions (implementation science).\u201d Most implementation strategies do not address the complex multilevel\ncontext for implementation in public service sectors. This proposed project will expand the Leadership and\nOrganizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention, an innovative organizational change strategy for\nEBP implementation and sustainment, to include partnership with a statewide Department of Mental Health and\nAddiction (DMHA) and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) in order to align state-level leadership\npolicies and directives with organizational implementation improvement strategies. SUDs are among the most\ncomplex of public health issues and Indiana ranks as the fourth worst state in providing SUD services with about\n8.5% of the population meeting criteria for a SUD, of whom only 13.6% seek treatment. Indiana DMHA\napproached the UCSD LOCI team to aid in the implementation of combined Motivational Enhancement\nTherapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) The main innovation in this project is that, consistent with the\nExploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework and system and organizational theory,\nwe will add a system level component to LOCI with the goal of bridging outer and inner context and developing\nand aligning a positive implementation climate to support implementation and sustainment of MET/CBT for\nSUDs. This project will test an implementation strategy that seeks to align, system, organization, and clinic\nleadership and strategies to implement and sustain an EBP for substance use disorders. The Leadership and\nOrganizational Change for Implementation - System Level (LOCI-SL) seeks to improve implementation\nleadership, climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, and EBP fidelity and client engagement in services. LOCI-\nSL will be tested in a statewide mental health and addiction service system and its community mental health\ncenters.",

The\nUnited States government has made huge investments in HIV care and research in Nigeria, through the\nPresidents Emergency Funds for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported programs and the National Institutes for\nHealth (NIH) research training grants that have supported the training of researchers in Nigerian universities.\nResearch on HIV in Nigeria has contributed significantly to the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV\nin the country as well to the development of international guidelines worldwide. The University of Nigeria Nsukka\n(UNN) College of Medicine has implemented multiple HIV research projects mostly as a sub-awardee. Findings\nfrom our rapid needs assessment with 84 UNN researchers and research administrators indicated that 93% of\nresearchers expressed interest in submitting grant applications, including for HIV research, but only 28% knew\nwho to contact for proposal and submission support at UNN. For UNN to successfully submit and manage grant\napplications as a prime institution, there is need to strengthen its research administration and management\ninfrastructure. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) further identify needs and gaps in research administration\nand management at UNN; 2) improve the grants management and proposal development knowledge and skills\nof UNN research administrators and HIV implementation researchers; and 3) strengthen the ability of UNN\nresearch administrators and HIV implementation researchers to submit and manage successful HIV grant\napplications by providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. UC\nSan Diego experts in research administration and grant management will implement the objectives of the\nproposed infrastructure development training program. The proposed program will be led by Dr. Gregory Aarons,\nProfessor and Director of UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute Dissemination and\nImplementation Science Center (DISC) as Program Director, and Dr. Echezona Ezeanolue, Professor and\nDirector of UNN Centre for Translation and Implementation Research (CTAIR) as Co-Director. Drs. Aarons and\nEzeanolue have an existing relationship and extensive experience building capacity in Nigerian institutions\nthrough the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA). A team of research administration and grant\nmanagement experts from UC San Diego will train and provide ongoing mentoring to research administrators\nand grant management staff at UNN over a 3-year period. By the end of this infrastructure development training\nprogram, 12 UNN research administrators and grant managers will be able to successfully submit and manage\nNIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other funded HIV grants.",

            "abstract_text": "Program Summary\nNigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. With\nan estimated female population of 102 million and HIV prevalence of 1.6% among adult females, Nigeria has the\nlargest population of women and the 4th largest number of women living with HIV (WLHIV) in Africa. Although\naccess to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WLHIV in Nigeria has increased over the years, with over 98% of\nthe 960,000 WLHIV on ART, AIDS-related mortality remains high. In 2020, 16,000 WLHIV died from AIDS-\nrelated illnesses including cervical cancer. A pilot implementation program in Nigeria demonstrated that\nleveraging the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported HIV programs for the\nprovision of evidence-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat interventions in WLWH is feasible. The pilot\nprogram demonstrated, however, that tailored implementation strategies will be needed to address specific\nmultilevel barriers along the cancer control continuum in order to address adoption, reach, and sustainability that\nare necessary for successful scale-up. However, in many African countries with a high burden of both HIV and\ncervical cancer, there is a paucity of evidence-based implementation strategies to inform effective integration of\nHIV and cervical cancer services delivery. Objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Refine strategies to integrate\ncervical cancer screening, treatment and management within existing comprehensive HIV treatment programs\nand determine implementation readiness; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of\nimplementation strategies versus Core+ enhanced implementation strategies; and 3) assess sustainment of the\nintegration of cervical cancer screening, treatment, and management intervention into HIV programs. We have\nassembled a strong team from University of California San Diego; University of Nigeria, Nsukka and John\nHopkins University with expertise in implementation science, HIV care and research, and cancer care and\nresearch. Our proposal is responsive to the NCI RFA and consistent with the World Health Organization global\nplan of elimination of cervical cancer by 2030. If effective, the proposed project will result in a set of feasible,\nculturally adaptable, and sustainable implementation strategies to integrate evidence-based cervical cancer\nscreening and treatment into HIV programs in order to improve the health and life expectancy of WLHIV.",

In this study, we aim to leverage the available infrastructure for HIV\ncare and treatment programs in Nigeria to integrate cervical cancer screening and treatment and conduct a\ncluster randomized, hybrid type III trial design to assess the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of\nimplementation strategies versus a Core+ (enhanced) set of implementation strategies to implement cervical\ncancer screening, onsite treatment, referral and referral completion, treatment, and retention in care\namong WLHIV.

This proposed project is consistent with NIDA\u2019s Priority Focus Area\n\u201cStrategies to improve the effective and sustainable implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment\ninterventions (implementation science).\u201d Most implementation strategies do not address the complex multilevel\ncontext for implementation in public service sectors. This proposed project will expand the Leadership and\nOrganizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention, an innovative organizational change strategy for\nEBP implementation and sustainment, to include partnership with a statewide Department of Mental Health and\nAddiction (DMHA) and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) in order to align state-level leadership\npolicies and directives with organizational implementation improvement strategies. SUDs are among the most\ncomplex of public health issues and Indiana ranks as the fourth worst state in providing SUD services with about\n8.5% of the population meeting criteria for a SUD, of whom only 13.6% seek treatment. Indiana DMHA\napproached the UCSD LOCI team to aid in the implementation of combined Motivational Enhancement\nTherapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) The main innovation in this project is that, consistent with the\nExploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework and system and organizational theory,\nwe will add a system level component to LOCI with the goal of bridging outer and inner context and developing\nand aligning a positive implementation climate to support implementation and sustainment of MET/CBT for\nSUDs. This project will test an implementation strategy that seeks to align, system, organization, and clinic\nleadership and strategies to implement and sustain an EBP for substance use disorders. The Leadership and\nOrganizational Change for Implementation - System Level (LOCI-SL) seeks to improve implementation\nleadership, climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, and EBP fidelity and client engagement in services. LOCI-\nSL will be tested in a statewide mental health and addiction service system and its community mental health\ncenters.",

The TEAMS Methods Core is integral to adapting and advancing team-based\nmodels, approaches, strategies, methods, and evaluation for children\u2019s mental health and for the larger center\nactivities. Of note, the Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing (NLP)\ntechnology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. Within community service\nsystems caring for children with mental health needs, the assessment of team effectiveness\u2014although crucial\nfor improving team functioning\u2014can be a laborious and cumbersome task. Innovations in technology related to\nthe automatic capturing of communication between team members can lessen the burden in assessing and\nimproving team effectiveness. The Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing\ntechnology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. The Methods Core\ninvestigators have already been collaborating closely with the Administrative Core, the R01, and the R34 teams,\nand Community Service System Workgroup stakeholders in selecting, adapting and shaping strategies and\napproaches to implementation and improvement for children\u2019s mental health across service system settings. The\nMethods Core is a team effort led by Drs. Aarons (implementation science, mental health), Burke (team\neffectiveness, team strategies), and Sklar (mental health services, evaluation) (see biosketches). The Methods\nCore is organized to address four aims: Aim 1) Integrate models and strategies from team effectiveness research\nand implementation science to improve children\u2019s mental health services, Aim 2) Apply multilevel and advanced\nmethods and designs for team-based implementation research, and Aim 3) Lead the design and implementation\nof a multi-level, longitudinal, iterative evaluation to refine the Center\u2019s research activities, maximize the Center\u2019s\nimpact and inform plans for future collaborative research.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY (R34#1 After Action Reviews in CWS)\nHalf of child-welfare involved children and adolescents meet criteria for at least one current mental disorder1.\nShared decision-making for Action Plans is vital to the mental health and wellbeing of children and families in\nChild Welfare Services (CWS), with fewer child removals and fewer recurrences2, thus resulting in decreased\nrisk of child trauma, behavioral concerns, and mental health concerns. Yet, neither parents nor caseworkers\nperceive that Action Plans include mutual influence3, and parents feel they have no voice or input4. Child and\nfamily team (CFT) meetings are required for each child or youth within sixty days of entering CWS, and are\nfamily-centered and collaborative ways to develop individualized, effective service plans based on mutual\nagreement5. Relying on teamwork approaches, CFT meetings intend to give children and families a voice in\ncreating and guiding their case plans6, suggest children do better when connected to their families and empower\nfamilies to work with CWS agencies7,8, and address organizational need for teams to perform \u201ccomplex,\ninterdependent, dynamic, and ambiguous tasks.\u201d9 Yet, in CWS CFT meetings, the quality of teamwork can be\nimpaired by the inherent challenges of serving multiple needs and viewpoints that vary across family members\nand professionals, as well as the pressures and constraints of CWS. Innovations from team effectiveness\nresearch hold promise in facilitating improvements in shared decision-making within CWS. The after-action\nreview (AAR) is a relatively simple, inexpensive, quick, and powerful tool to improve learning, performance, and\nthe effectiveness of teams and individuals. AARs are active self-learning processes wherein team members\nreflect on specific performance episode to actively engage in self-discovery and improve learning in a non-\npunitive/non-judgmental manner. AARs have become a common tool that organizations have leveraged in\nmilitary, medical, educational, and other applications, to improve individual and team performance by\napproximately 20-25%. This proposal aims to apply the team development intervention of the after-action review\n(AAR) to improve implementation of the Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings currently used in the CWS. This\nproposal will tailor and assess the impact of the AAR on enhancing CFT outcomes by addressing the following:\nSpecific Aim 1. Conduct a qualitative needs assessment targeting the ongoing implementation of the CFT clinical\nintervention in a large, publicly funded, County CWS system; Specific Aim 2. Adapt and tailor the AAR team\neffectiveness intervention to address the CFT services intervention needs; Aim 3. Assess mechanisms of the\nAAR team effectiveness intervention for CFT implementation and a novel application of natural language\nprocessing methods. Aim 3.a. Pilot-test the AAR implementation strategy on improving CFT outcomes, and\nexplore team mechanisms; Aim 3b. Identify and leverage CFT communication language data sources that are\nfeasible, naturally occurring, and appropriate for the CWS context to submit to methods core for aggregation\nacross projects.",

            "abstract_text": "Program Summary\nNigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. The\nUnited States government has made huge investments in HIV care and research in Nigeria, through the\nPresidents Emergency Funds for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported programs and the National Institutes for\nHealth (NIH) research training grants that have supported the training of researchers in Nigerian universities.\nResearch on HIV in Nigeria has contributed significantly to the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV\nin the country as well to the development of international guidelines worldwide. The University of Nigeria Nsukka\n(UNN) College of Medicine has implemented multiple HIV research projects mostly as a sub-awardee. Findings\nfrom our rapid needs assessment with 84 UNN researchers and research administrators indicated that 93% of\nresearchers expressed interest in submitting grant applications, including for HIV research, but only 28% knew\nwho to contact for proposal and submission support at UNN. For UNN to successfully submit and manage grant\napplications as a prime institution, there is need to strengthen its research administration and management\ninfrastructure. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) further identify needs and gaps in research administration\nand management at UNN; 2) improve the grants management and proposal development knowledge and skills\nof UNN research administrators and HIV implementation researchers; and 3) strengthen the ability of UNN\nresearch administrators and HIV implementation researchers to submit and manage successful HIV grant\napplications by providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. UC\nSan Diego experts in research administration and grant management will implement the objectives of the\nproposed infrastructure development training program. The proposed program will be led by Dr. Gregory Aarons,\nProfessor and Director of UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute Dissemination and\nImplementation Science Center (DISC) as Program Director, and Dr. Echezona Ezeanolue, Professor and\nDirector of UNN Centre for Translation and Implementation Research (CTAIR) as Co-Director. Drs. Aarons and\nEzeanolue have an existing relationship and extensive experience building capacity in Nigerian institutions\nthrough the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA). A team of research administration and grant\nmanagement experts from UC San Diego will train and provide ongoing mentoring to research administrators\nand grant management staff at UNN over a 3-year period. By the end of this infrastructure development training\nprogram, 12 UNN research administrators and grant managers will be able to successfully submit and manage\nNIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other funded HIV grants.",

My research focuses on\npalliative care (PC), cancer and women\u2019s health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This\nadministrative supplement mentor award will provide me with the support needed to achieve the following 3 key\ncareer development objectives for research in LMIC settings: (1) Sharpen my skills in community based\nparticipatory research, stakeholder\u2019s engagement and program integration especially in PC clinical settings; (2)\nAcquire in-depth knowledge of implementation frameworks and methods to help close the gap between\nimplementation science and implementation practice; (3) Acquire skills and content expertise in PC research. I\nwill conduct research and work with my mentors for a minimum of 40% of my time within the Nigerian\nImplementation Science Alliance-Model Innovation and Research Centers (NISA-MIRCs), a practice-based\nresearch network across the six geographical regions in Nigeria. To accomplish these objectives, I have put\ntogether a mentoring team including: (1) a US Primary Mentor, Prof. Gregory Aarons from University of California,\nSan Diego who is an expert in Implementation Science; (2) a LMIC Primary Mentor, Prof. Echezona Ezeanolue\nfrom the University of Nigeria, who is an expert in community-based participatory research and clinical research;\n(3) a LMIC Co-Mentor, Dr Tonia Onyeka from University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital [UNTH], who is an expert\nin PC research and practice; (4) a LMIC Peer-Mentor, Dr John Olawepo from Center of Translation and\nImplementation Research [CTAIR], who is an expert in health systems integration. My team of mentors will\nsupport my capacity building and research project, which includes a pilot study to explore the feasibility and\nacceptability of a culturally adapted and integrated PC package to promote wellbeing of women living with HIV\n(WLHIV) and cervical cancers. My specific aims are to: (1) Co-create and develop feasible, culturally adapted,\nand sustainable PC service package with WLHIV and cervical cancer from the NISA-MIRCs. We will adapt core\nelements of PC services recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline using\nwell-established mixed method approaches; and (2) Pilot the adapted multicomponent PC package to determine\nfeasibility and acceptability at two NISA-MIRCs facilities. During the year of this administrative award, my Nigeria-\nand US-based mentors, co-mentor, and peer-mentor will provide additional training and guidance in their areas\nof expertise including implementation science, community based participatory research, PC, and health systems\nintegration.",

            "abstract_text": "Program Summary\nNigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. With\nan estimated female population of 102 million and HIV prevalence of 1.6% among adult females, Nigeria has the\nlargest population of women and the 4th largest number of women living with HIV (WLHIV) in Africa. Although\naccess to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WLHIV in Nigeria has increased over the years, with over 98% of\nthe 960,000 WLHIV on ART, AIDS-related mortality remains high. In 2020, 16,000 WLHIV died from AIDS-\nrelated illnesses including cervical cancer. A pilot implementation program in Nigeria demonstrated that\nleveraging the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported HIV programs for the\nprovision of evidence-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat interventions in WLWH is feasible. The pilot\nprogram demonstrated, however, that tailored implementation strategies will be needed to address specific\nmultilevel barriers along the cancer control continuum in order to address adoption, reach, and sustainability that\nare necessary for successful scale-up. However, in many African countries with a high burden of both HIV and\ncervical cancer, there is a paucity of evidence-based implementation strategies to inform effective integration of\nHIV and cervical cancer services delivery. Objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Refine strategies to integrate\ncervical cancer screening, treatment and management within existing comprehensive HIV treatment programs\nand determine implementation readiness; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of\nimplementation strategies versus Core+ enhanced implementation strategies; and 3) assess sustainment of the\nintegration of cervical cancer screening, treatment, and management intervention into HIV programs. We have\nassembled a strong team from University of California San Diego; University of Nigeria, Nsukka and John\nHopkins University with expertise in implementation science, HIV care and research, and cancer care and\nresearch. Our proposal is responsive to the NCI RFA and consistent with the World Health Organization global\nplan of elimination of cervical cancer by 2030. If effective, the proposed project will result in a set of feasible,\nculturally adaptable, and sustainable implementation strategies to integrate evidence-based cervical cancer\nscreening and treatment into HIV programs in order to improve the health and life expectancy of WLHIV.",

In this study, we aim to leverage the available infrastructure for HIV\ncare and treatment programs in Nigeria to integrate cervical cancer screening and treatment and conduct a\ncluster randomized, hybrid type III trial design to assess the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of\nimplementation strategies versus a Core+ (enhanced) set of implementation strategies to implement cervical\ncancer screening, onsite treatment, referral and referral completion, treatment, and retention in care\namong WLHIV. The overarching goal is to improve the health and life expectancy of WLHIV with co-occurring\ncervical cancer.",

The candidate\u2019s first aim will examine the\ntolerability, safety and feasibility of frontal pole intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) for Veterans with mild\ntraumatic brain injury (mTBI), negative urgency impulsivity, [and suicidal ideation]. This is important because\nimpulsivity, which is exhibited in up to 40% of individuals with TBI, is an independent risk factor for dying by\nsuicide and is associated with poorer functional outcomes following TBI. Presently, there are no widely\naccepted treatment strategies for impulsivity, [suicidal ideation and social and occupational functional deficits]\nfollowing TBI. The candidate\u2019s second aim is to determine the effects of frontal pole iTBS on social and\ncommunity functioning, negative urgency impulsivity and [suicidal ideation]. This will allow the scientific\ncommunity to better understand how frontal pole iTBS treatment impacts [social and community] functioning\nand mental health outcomes. Finally, the candidate aims to evaluate whether iTBS improves connectivity\nbetween the VMPFC and limbic system, using resting state functional connectivity MRI. Completing this aim\nwill allow us to better understand how iTBS affects neural connectivity and whether these changes are related\nto functional and mental health outcomes.\n This research is critical as suicide is a major issue among Veterans within the VA system. Veterans are\n22% more likely to die by suicide than civilians. Veterans with TBI are even more likely to die by suicide than\nthose without TBI. It is important to create a treatment to prevent unnecessary Veteran deaths while helping\nVeterans feel empowered and functional within their communities. [Suicide and TBI are not unique to Veterans,\nhowever. Civilians with TBI are also more likely to die by suicide than those without. Thus, findings from this\nresearch could serve to improve neuropsychiatric care in the civilian sector, as well.] This project serves as a\ncritical first step in allowing the candidate and her team to develop a biologically-informed treatment strategy\nfor the many individuals who struggle with mTBI, [social and occupational functional deficits], impulsivity and\n[suicidal ideation].\n Ultimately, the candidate\u2019s long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical researcher in the\nVA system with expertise in TBI, suicidality, neurostimulation and neuroimaging. As such, she will complete a\ncareful training plan under the mentorship of a strong, multidisciplinary training team involving opportunities for\nnetworking with experts in fields relating to the above research, hands-on training in necessary research skills\nand coursework complementary to the research project.\n The planned research is significant, innovative, and impactful, as it will be the first pilot study of a new\niTBS treatment paradigm, designed to improve Veteran lives and functional outcomes after mTBI. It will also\nstrengthen the candidate\u2019s knowledge base and research skills, preparing her for an independent career in\npost-TBI rehabilitation research, with expertise in impulsivity, suicidality and neuromodulation.",

The planned duration is up to 2 years\nfor each predoctoral slot and up to 3 years for each postdoctoral slot. The projected number of individuals to\nbe trained over the proposed project period is 15 predoctoral and 10 postdoctoral fellows. Its leadership has\nextensive experience in cancer research mentoring and a well-documented commitment to both graduate\neducation and postdoctoral training. This institutional program encompasses training faculty from 6 basic\nand 4 clinical departments as well as 12 matrix institutes and involves laboratory and computational\nresearch. The dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of the Program is evidenced by co- authored papers\nand multi-investigator grants. All faculty members have peer-reviewed R01 or R01-equivalent support\nfrom funding agencies for cancer-related studies. The Program attracts and develops a cadre of outstanding\nPh.D. and M.D., Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral fellows, with our earliest trainees having established\ncancer-focused research careers at prestigious institutions. The curriculum for predoctoral and\npostdoctoral trainees involves common elements including several new advanced didactic and multi-modal\ncancer biology courses and advanced electives, which impart state-of-the-art training in emerging\ntechnologies critical to basic and translational cancer investigations. All trainees also participate in\nregular conferences, which further expose them to clinical aspects of cancer. There are important specific\ntraining elements for each component as well. There is a rigorous evaluation and selection process, and\nthe program is both cognizant of and actively involved in diversity recruitment. New components of the\nprogram also include additional training venues to specifically aid postdoctoral trainees in seeking\nacademic positions and a formal training faculty track in which promising junior faculty members may\napply with a training faculty member to co-mentor a highly qualified trainee, an approach providing\nmentorship by the training faculty member both of the trainee and the faculty co-mentor. The program has\ncontributed importantly to the remarkable increase in cancer research and NCI funding over the past\ndecade. Mount Sinai has also made enormous commitments in resources and facilities benefitting the\nProgram including support for specific elements by the Tisch Cancer Institute an NCI designated Cancer\nCenter and the Department of Oncological Sciences. Trainees work closely with faculty drawn from\nthroughout Mount Sinai ensuring that their training is both rigorous and sufficiently broad in scope to\ntake into account practical issues faced by physicians in preventing and treating cancer.",

The presence of carcinogens and inducers of inflammation in WTC\ndust have raised the possibility that those exposed to WTC dust during the 9/11 attacks could have increased\ncancer incidence. To date, several cohort studies indicate that total cancer rates are 6-14% above background\nrates with significantly greater increases for thyroid and prostate cancer (Moir, 2016; Solan, 2013; Li, 2012;\nJordan, 2011; Zeig-Owens, 2011).\nIncreased exposure based on the time of arrival for workers, their proximity to early response to the WTC and\nduration of exposure have been associated with increased risk of tumor progression (de la Hoz, 2008; Lioy and\nGeorgopoulos, 2006). Recent studies in small animal models indicate that WTC dust particles or metals are\nundetectable or present at exceedingly low levels in prostate tissues compared to lung following WTC dust\nexposure by inhalation or gavage (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019), and long-term studies of rodents have not revealed\nevidence of a direct carcinogenic mechanism. Instead, there is evidence from both human RNA expression and\nDNA methylation analyses (Yu, 2022) and animal models (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019) that inflammation induced\nby this dust may be implicated in promoting prostate cancer. In the mouse, WTC dust exposure promotes\nsystemic as well as localized prostate inflammation, increased growth in PTEN deficient prostate epithelia and\npromotion of genetically initiated prostate tumors (Wang, 2022).\nAim 1 will investigate whether WTC associated prostate cancer is more likely to recur independent of tumor\ngrade at diagnosis and if there are molecular signatures of aggressiveness at diagnosis in those who recur. We\nwill utilize increased biochemical (PSA) recurrence to define responders with adverse clinical response to WTC\ndust following surgery or radiation therapy. We will also apply recently identified signatures by RNA expression\nanalysis and mass spec multiplex immunostaining of primary prostate cancer tissues to test whether these\nimmune/inflammatory markers correlate with increased tumor recurrence in WTC responders.\nAim 2 will focus on correlating our human findings with those in mouse genetically engineered mouse models\nbearing targeted lesions to prostate that model human PC. These experiments take advantage of our strong\npreliminary evidence that these models support a role of WTC dust exposure in PC progression. Experiments\nwill include testing whether WTC dust exposure promotes recurrence of genetically initiated PCs following\nandrogen deprivation therapy and/or experimental PC metastasis. We will also compare, and contrast WTC dust\nassociated immune/inflammatory biomarkers in the mouse with those identified in human PCs.\nOur overarching goal is to translate understanding gained toward improved surveillance of WTC responders\nmost at risk for prostate cancer.",

The planned duration is up to 2 years\nfor each predoctoral slot and up to 3 years for each postdoctoral slot. The projected number of individuals to\nbe trained over the proposed project period is 15 predoctoral and 10 postdoctoral fellows. Its leadership has\nextensive experience in cancer research mentoring and a well-documented commitment to both graduate\neducation and postdoctoral training. This institutional program encompasses training faculty from 6 basic\nand 4 clinical departments as well as 12 matrix institutes and involves laboratory and computational\nresearch. The dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of the Program is evidenced by co- authored papers\nand multi-investigator grants. All faculty members have peer-reviewed R01 or R01-equivalent support\nfrom funding agencies for cancer-related studies. The Program attracts and develops a cadre of outstanding\nPh.D. and M.D., Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral fellows, with our earliest trainees having established\ncancer-focused research careers at prestigious institutions. The curriculum for predoctoral and\npostdoctoral trainees involves common elements including several new advanced didactic and multi-modal\ncancer biology courses and advanced electives, which impart state-of-the-art training in emerging\ntechnologies critical to basic and translational cancer investigations. All trainees also participate in\nregular conferences, which further expose them to clinical aspects of cancer. There are important specific\ntraining elements for each component as well. There is a rigorous evaluation and selection process, and\nthe program is both cognizant of and actively involved in diversity recruitment. New components of the\nprogram also include additional training venues to specifically aid postdoctoral trainees in seeking\nacademic positions and a formal training faculty track in which promising junior faculty members may\napply with a training faculty member to co-mentor a highly qualified trainee, an approach providing\nmentorship by the training faculty member both of the trainee and the faculty co-mentor. The program has\ncontributed importantly to the remarkable increase in cancer research and NCI funding over the past\ndecade. Mount Sinai has also made enormous commitments in resources and facilities benefitting the\nProgram including support for specific elements by the Tisch Cancer Institute an NCI designated Cancer\nCenter and the Department of Oncological Sciences. Trainees work closely with faculty drawn from\nthroughout Mount Sinai ensuring that their training is both rigorous and sufficiently broad in scope to\ntake into account practical issues faced by physicians in preventing and treating cancer.",

The presence of carcinogens and inducers of inflammation in WTC\ndust have raised the possibility that those exposed to WTC dust during the 9/11 attacks could have increased\ncancer incidence. To date, several cohort studies indicate that total cancer rates are 6-14% above background\nrates with significantly greater increases for thyroid and prostate cancer (Moir, 2016; Solan, 2013; Li, 2012;\nJordan, 2011; Zeig-Owens, 2011).\nIncreased exposure based on the time of arrival for workers, their proximity to early response to the WTC and\nduration of exposure have been associated with increased risk of tumor progression (de la Hoz, 2008; Lioy and\nGeorgopoulos, 2006). Recent studies in small animal models indicate that WTC dust particles or metals are\nundetectable or present at exceedingly low levels in prostate tissues compared to lung following WTC dust\nexposure by inhalation or gavage (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019), and long-term studies of rodents have not revealed\nevidence of a direct carcinogenic mechanism. Instead, there is evidence from both human RNA expression and\nDNA methylation analyses (Yu, 2022) and animal models (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019) that inflammation induced\nby this dust may be implicated in promoting prostate cancer. In the mouse, WTC dust exposure promotes\nsystemic as well as localized prostate inflammation, increased growth in PTEN deficient prostate epithelia and\npromotion of genetically initiated prostate tumors (Wang, 2022).\nAim 1 will investigate whether WTC associated prostate cancer is more likely to recur independent of tumor\ngrade at diagnosis and if there are molecular signatures of aggressiveness at diagnosis in those who recur. We\nwill utilize increased biochemical (PSA) recurrence to define responders with adverse clinical response to WTC\ndust following surgery or radiation therapy. We will also apply recently identified signatures by RNA expression\nanalysis and mass spec multiplex immunostaining of primary prostate cancer tissues to test whether these\nimmune/inflammatory markers correlate with increased tumor recurrence in WTC responders.\nAim 2 will focus on correlating our human findings with those in mouse genetically engineered mouse models\nbearing targeted lesions to prostate that model human PC. These experiments take advantage of our strong\npreliminary evidence that these models support a role of WTC dust exposure in PC progression. Experiments\nwill include testing whether WTC dust exposure promotes recurrence of genetically initiated PCs following\nandrogen deprivation therapy and/or experimental PC metastasis. We will also compare, and contrast WTC dust\nassociated immune/inflammatory biomarkers in the mouse with those identified in human PCs.\nOur overarching goal is to translate understanding gained toward improved surveillance of WTC responders\nmost at risk for prostate cancer.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThe placenta is a vital fetal organ that serves to oxygenate, nourish, and remove waste from fetal blood in\nutero. Robust maternal perfusion is essential for this function and requires high capacitance, slow blood flow to\nthe placenta. Maternal-placental perfusion can be temporarily compromised by uterine contractions, which\noccur throughout pregnancy, also known as Braxton Hicks contractions. Healthy fetuses with normally\ndeveloped placentas have enough placental reserve capacity that Braxton Hicks contractions and minor\nvascular pathology do not significantly affect necessary placental oxygen transport. However, in dysfunctional\nplacentas with poor reserve (as in some placentas associated with intrauterine growth restriction-IUGR) these\nevents may lead to hypoxic stress. There is a lack of information and quantitative data regarding the effect of\nantepartum uterine activity (Braxton Hicks contractions) in human pregnancies and whether these findings may\nhelp to characterize placental reserve and function and inform development of future tests to identify fetuses at\nrisk for adverse outcomes during delivery mediated by placental dysfunction. New methods to assess\nuteroplacental function in humans and the impact of contractions on fetal respiratory exchange across\npregnancy in pregnancies with normally growing and IUGR fetuses are needed. Here, we will characterize\nBraxton Hicks contractions across gestation, analyze spatiotemporal changes in placental oxygenation during\nthese contractions and monitor the effect of these placental oxygenation changes on fetal movement and organ\noxygenation via MRI. Our hypothesis is that the change in placental flow during Braxton Hicks contractions\nmay have a larger impact on placental oxygen transport for IUGR fetuses compared to normally growing ones.\nIf successful we will have identified placental and fetal MR signal changes during contractions as a possible\nmethod to understand individual placental reserve. Such understanding may enable the development of novel\ntherapies and the ability to monitor changes in these dynamics is critical to the assessment of the impact of\nnovel therapies. Towards this end, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize Braxton Hicks\ncontractions and the associated change in placental oxygenation across gestation in pregnancies with\nnormally growing and IUGR fetuses. We will characterize placental oxygenation using T2* mapping approach\nand analyze regional differences in placental T2*. Then we will compare and correlate differences in\npregnancies with normally growing and IUGR fetuses. Aim 2: Determine the impact of placental oxygenation\nchange during Braxton Hicks contractions on fetal motion and brain and liver oxygenation in pregnancies with\nnormally growing and IUGR fetuses. We will track fetal motion and characterize fetal brain and liver\noxygenation using T2* mapping. Then we will compare and correlate differences in pregnancies with normally\ngrowing and IUGR fetuses.",

            "abstract_text": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD\nis a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information\nabout the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where\nquantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study\nhas recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in\nevaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different\nscanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and\nharmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners.\nThis goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical\nphantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD\npatients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not\nfully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across\ndifferent scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed\nradiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where\nstudies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable\nand practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners.\nSuch models are currently lacking in the context of COPD.\nWe develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT\nbiomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the\nfirst library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate\nmodels of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT\ncases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of\ncurrent and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms\n(through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and\noptimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the\nalgorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images\n. We\nthen harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging\nbiomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies.\nThe studies will be done for the top two image\nprocessing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts,\nthe project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD.",

Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information\nabout the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where\nquantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study\nhas recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in\nevaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different\nscanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and\nharmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners.\nThis goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical\nphantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD\npatients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not\nfully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across\ndifferent scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed\nradiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where\nstudies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable\nand practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners.\nSuch models are currently lacking in the context of COPD.\nWe develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT\nbiomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes.

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCeliac disease (CeD) is a complex intestinal inflammatory disorder that is triggered by dietary gluten and\ndevelops in genetically susceptible individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules. 1% of the\nworldwide population is affected by this disease for which the only effective treatment is a lifelong and\nrestrictive gluten-free diet (GFD). Yet, persistent symptoms and enteropathy remain commonplace even\namong CeD patients that adhere to a GFD. This stresses the need to develop non-dietary interventions for\nCeD. The development of new therapies has however proven challenging because of our incomplete\nunderstanding of the immune mechanisms underlying CeD pathogenesis and the lack of a suitable mouse\nmodel. CeD is characterized by the loss of oral tolerance to gluten manifested by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8-\nrestricted anti-gluten inflammatory CD4 T cells in the small intestinal mucosa and by a massive expansion of\ncytotoxic intraepithelial CD8+ lymphocytes (IE-CTLs) that are involved in the killing of intestinal epithelial cells.\nThese observations have led to the general idea that CeD is primarily a T cell-mediated immune disorder. We\nhypothesize, however, that B cells also play a critical role. This hypothesis stems from several observations.\nFirst, CeD is characterized by a considerable expansion of plasma cells in the mucosa of CeD patients as well\nas the development of anti-deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) antibodies and autoantibodies against the\nenzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Second, the main model to explain the production of anti-DGP and\nanti-TG2 antibodies is that gluten-specific CD4+ T cells provide help to B cells suggesting that B cells could act\nas antigen-presenting cells for T cells and promote the amplification of the anti-gluten CD4 T cell response.\nFinally, several case reports on patients having CeD associated with another autoimmune disease suggest\nthat B cell depletion therapy can provide clinical benefit in CeD, and we have demonstrated that B cell\ndepletion significantly reduces intestinal tissue damage in our mouse model of CeD. The objective of this\napplication is to characterize in vivo the role of B cells in amplifying the anti-gluten T cell response and allow it\nto reach a sufficient magnitude to promote tissue destruction. This project is innovative as it employs unique\nmouse models of CeD allowing to manipulate B lymphocytes, gluten-specific T cells, the gluten antigen, and\nthe CeD predisposing HLA molecule to 1) assess the contribution of B cells as antigen-presenting to the\nactivation and amplification of the anti-gluten CD4+ T cell response, and 2) assess the role of B cells and\nantibodies in the activation of IE-CTLs and tissue destruction. The knowledge gained from this study will\nprovide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms by which B cell-mediated immunity contribute to the\npathogenesis of CeD and will assess for the first time the therapeutic potential of B cell depletion therapy in an\nexperimental mouse model of CeD.",

            "abstract_text": "Dr. Peter Abadir is an active Geriatrician and associate professor of Medicine, Electrical, and Computer Engi-\nneering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). He has put forth this K24 Mid-Career Development proposal dedi-\ncated to mentorship in patient-centric translational research. Dr. Abadir\u2019s research connects molecular\nchanges associated with aging to physical and cognitive declines observed in older adults. He's been instru-\nmental in bridging the fields of aging research and engineering at JHU, leading to the creation of both the Hop-\nkins GeroTech Program and Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratory (AITC) for Aging Research.\nCandidate: Dr. Abadir is committed to further training to broaden his research program and mentor emerging\nscholars from both biology and engineering. Recognized as an accomplished clinician-scientist, he boasts sig-\nnificant achievements in translational research, particularly concerning frailty and Alzheimer's disease. His es-\ncalating leadership roles span both institutional and national platforms centered on patient-oriented research\nand aging-focused mentorship. As the co-PI of the Johns Hopkins AITC and the co-director of its Clinical\nTranslation and Validation Core, Dr. Abadir actively contributes to the innovation of technologies tailored for\nolder adults. Furthermore, he directs the molecular measurement core at the Older American Independence\nCenter (OAIC) and is the associate director of the Translational Aging Research Training Program (T32).\nMentoring Plan/Environment: Dr. Abadir's K24 proposal taps into the wealth of training assets at Johns Hop-\nkins including resources from the JHU AITC, OAIC, the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, and\nvarious T32 training grants. Special attention is given to recruiting underrepresented minorities. Ideal mentees\nexhibit interest at the intersection of aging, technology, and Geroscience. The structured mentoring approach\ncategorizes mentees based on experience, allocating specific effort percentages to ensure quality interactions.\nRegular individual meetings, hands-on research training, data interpretation, and presentation skills enhance-\nment form core of mentoring strategy. Multi-tiered evaluations ensure consistent mentorship quality. This strat-\negy aims to cultivate future leaders in translational aging research from both biological and engineering fields.\nResearch Plan: The pioneering research funded by this K24 award aims to harness Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ntools and analytics for assessing physical and cognitive digital biosignals in frail older individuals including\nthose with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and associating these with molecular markers. The study will evaluate the ac-\ncuracy and reliability of a new method that uses AI to analyze non-invasive multimodal biometric signals like\nspeech, voice, eye movements, handwriting, and gait. This methodology will enhance our understanding of the\nvaried characteristics of frailty in older individuals and pinpoint early cognitive shifts, including signs of Alz-\nheimer\u2019s. Building upon the existing efforts at Johns Hopkins AITC and OAIC, this research seeks to uncover\nnew insights and broaden avenues for upcoming researchers.",

Key to this challenge are the development of a better understanding of the underlying\nbiological basis that contributes to frailty and the identification of key biological pathways for the development\nof interventions that might help prevent or alleviate frailty and loss of independence. The goal of Johns Hopkins\nOlder Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Biological Mechanisms Core (RC-2) is to enable the next\ngeneration of frailty-related etiological discovery and to promote the translation of these discoveries into\nclinically relevant diagnostic, preventive, and treatment modalities. This will be achieved through the provision\nof high-quality biological and bioengineering measurement expertise, incorporation of new technologies,\nanalytical and computational expertise for genetics and omics analyses, and infrastructure necessary to attain\nthis goal. In order to comprehensively encompass the biological expertise necessary to study frailty-related\netiology, we have engaged a leadership team and internal consultants with complementary and synergistic\nbiological and translational expertise needed to unravel the complex biological mechanisms that underpin\nfrailty. They also all bring mentorship skills for trainees, and infrastructure to RC-2 and national prominence to\nfrailty research. The specific aims of RC-2 are to: 1) provide state of the art scientific expertise, infrastructure,\nand technology necessary to advance biological and etiological research related to frailty, 2) provide access to\nbiological samples from human subjects and from animal models necessary to test hypotheses related to\nfrailty, 3) facilitate the translation of biological findings into interventions or prevention-focused clinical studies,\n4) provide training, mentorship, and guidance to promising junior investigators around biological mechanisms\nthat impact frailty, and 5) provide institutional and external visibility for RC-2 related science and activities. Our\naims will be accomplished through close communication between the core leaders and their laboratories, close\npartnership with the other OAIC cores, and the engagement of expert consultants in the highly relevant areas\nof mitochondrial measurement, metabolomics, epigenetics, mouse model development, nanotechnologies for\ndiagnostic and treatment development, and the development of multi-omic analyses related to frailty. By\nproviding these resources, RC-2 will foster high quality research that elucidates clinically relevant biological\npathways that underlie frailty and related interventions that hold promise to attenuate frailty, related conditions,\nand the loss of independence.",

To date, little progress has been made to improve our understanding of resilience with aging and\nits multi-component dimensions in response to physical, cognitive, and social stressors, in part because\nresilience itself is likely a dynamic multi-systemic process that is most evident under conditions of stress. This\napplication is for a five-year cooperative conference grant to continue the successful \u201cGeriatrics Research:\nBench-to-Bedside\u201d series. The series has had an outstanding impact. Past conferences represented\n\u201cparadigm-shifting\u201d moments and \u201cpivotal\u201d junctures in areas such as frailty, multimorbidity, and delirium. Here\nwe propose to build bridges and bring together resilience scientists and experts from the physical, cognitive,\nand social domains to discuss, debate, and learn from each other the dynamic multi-component phenomena of\nresilience. In the first conference, Overview of the Resilience World: State of the Science, we will focus on\nsetting the stage and discuss working definitions of resilience from physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fields.\nA goal will be to identify areas of commonalities and differences and how we can operationalize a shared\nconcept so that \u201cresilience\u201d can be quantified appropriately in different contexts. In the second conference,\nStress tests and Biomarkers of Resilience, we aim to discuss resilience stress test paradigms and\nmolecular markers that may be associated with resilient outcomes. Building on the first conference, this\nconference will refer to operationalized definitions of resilience and resilient outcomes, acknowledging that\ndefinitions may differ slightly across fields and contexts. Lastly, the third conference is entitled Optimizing\nResilience. By integrating the foundation built in the first two conferences, we will focus on interventions to\noptimize resilience in older adults. This conference series, once completed, will serve as a forum and a\nunifying thread that will bring together national research leaders to build an integrative multidimensional\nunderstanding of resilience in older organisms.",

In parallel, there has been a rapid expansion in the understanding of aging-related biology\nthat may drive these changes, and a rapid expansion in the development of bioengineering and engineering\napproaches that can be utilized to help solve health care-related issues. Despite this progress, there remains a\ngap in the ability to translate biological understanding and engineered approaches into modalities that improve\nthe health and well-being of older adults. In order to further accelerate the pace of discovery in this space, The\nTranslational Aging Research Training Program was successfully implemented in 2018. Despite COVID-19\nrelated disruptions, 14 fellows from clinical, engineering, and biological disciplines were trained to work in this\nspace during the first cycle. The Johns Hopkins Human Aging Project (HAP) has been intentionally designed\nas a hub that provides interdisciplinary connections with focus on accelerating improvements in the healthspan\nof older adults. This renewal application describes an updated training program that will take place within the\nunique HAP ecosystem. The scientific leadership, the research infrastructure, and the diverse and inclusive\nenvironment in this ecosystem will continue to provide an outstanding translational research training venue in\nthe next cycle. Specific aims include: 1) the implementation of a diverse, inclusive and rigorous interdisciplinary\ntraining program in translational aging research for post-doctoral fellows with MD and PhD degrees through a\nstructured program consisting of a core series of required coursework, interdisciplinary scientific meetings,\nweekly trainee focused translational aging seminars, individualized training programs, and leadership and\ncareer development seminars; 2) the provision of trainees with a primary directed translational aging laboratory\nexperience (either engineering or biology focused) or clinically oriented research project in collaboration with\nan experienced mentor with research resources; 3) the provision of trainees with access to the robust\ninterdisciplinary and translation-focused aging research infrastructure and collaborative research opportunities\navailable at Johns Hopkins, and 4) the preparation of the trainees for sustained academic careers through\nindividualized mentorship and by utilizing the leadership and career development resources that are available\nat Johns Hopkins University. At the end of this training program, trainees will have broad interdisciplinary\nknowledge of aging biology, engineering and bioengineering approaches to problem solving, and major clinical\nissues facing older adults, a broad knowledge of translational science, and the tools necessary to start a\nsuccessful academic career. Further, the trainee will have learned career development and leadership skill\nsets that will facilitate the future development of influential interdisciplinary translational aging careers and\nresearch programs.",

To date, little progress has been made to improve our understanding of resilience with aging and\nits multi-component dimensions in response to physical, cognitive, and social stressors, in part because\nresilience itself is likely a dynamic multi-systemic process that is most evident under conditions of stress. This\napplication is for a five-year cooperative conference grant to continue the successful \u201cGeriatrics Research:\nBench-to-Bedside\u201d series. The series has had an outstanding impact. Past conferences represented\n\u201cparadigm-shifting\u201d moments and \u201cpivotal\u201d junctures in areas such as frailty, multimorbidity, and delirium. Here\nwe propose to build bridges and bring together resilience scientists and experts from the physical, cognitive,\nand social domains to discuss, debate, and learn from each other the dynamic multi-component phenomena of\nresilience. In the first conference, Overview of the Resilience World: State of the Science, we will focus on\nsetting the stage and discuss working definitions of resilience from physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fields.\nA goal will be to identify areas of commonalities and differences and how we can operationalize a shared\nconcept so that \u201cresilience\u201d can be quantified appropriately in different contexts. In the second conference,\nStress tests and Biomarkers of Resilience, we aim to discuss resilience stress test paradigms and\nmolecular markers that may be associated with resilient outcomes. Building on the first conference, this\nconference will refer to operationalized definitions of resilience and resilient outcomes, acknowledging that\ndefinitions may differ slightly across fields and contexts. Lastly, the third conference is entitled Optimizing\nResilience. By integrating the foundation built in the first two conferences, we will focus on interventions to\noptimize resilience in older adults. This conference series, once completed, will serve as a forum and a\nunifying thread that will bring together national research leaders to build an integrative multidimensional\nunderstanding of resilience in older organisms.",

Key to this challenge are the development of a better understanding of the underlying\nbiological basis that contributes to frailty and the identification of key biological pathways for the development\nof interventions that might help prevent or alleviate frailty and loss of independence. The goal of Johns Hopkins\nOlder Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Biological Mechanisms Core (RC-2) is to enable the next\ngeneration of frailty-related etiological discovery and to promote the translation of these discoveries into\nclinically relevant diagnostic, preventive, and treatment modalities. This will be achieved through the provision\nof high-quality biological and bioengineering measurement expertise, incorporation of new technologies,\nanalytical and computational expertise for genetics and omics analyses, and infrastructure necessary to attain\nthis goal. In order to comprehensively encompass the biological expertise necessary to study frailty-related\netiology, we have engaged a leadership team and internal consultants with complementary and synergistic\nbiological and translational expertise needed to unravel the complex biological mechanisms that underpin\nfrailty. They also all bring mentorship skills for trainees, and infrastructure to RC-2 and national prominence to\nfrailty research. The specific aims of RC-2 are to: 1) provide state of the art scientific expertise, infrastructure,\nand technology necessary to advance biological and etiological research related to frailty, 2) provide access to\nbiological samples from human subjects and from animal models necessary to test hypotheses related to\nfrailty, 3) facilitate the translation of biological findings into interventions or prevention-focused clinical studies,\n4) provide training, mentorship, and guidance to promising junior investigators around biological mechanisms\nthat impact frailty, and 5) provide institutional and external visibility for RC-2 related science and activities. Our\naims will be accomplished through close communication between the core leaders and their laboratories, close\npartnership with the other OAIC cores, and the engagement of expert consultants in the highly relevant areas\nof mitochondrial measurement, metabolomics, epigenetics, mouse model development, nanotechnologies for\ndiagnostic and treatment development, and the development of multi-omic analyses related to frailty. By\nproviding these resources, RC-2 will foster high quality research that elucidates clinically relevant biological\npathways that underlie frailty and related interventions that hold promise to attenuate frailty, related conditions,\nand the loss of independence.",

These\nmodels will be used to identify new therapeutic candidates and predict\nmechanism of action of drugs. Since 2007 we collaborated and published with\nover sixty research laboratories and used structural models to understand\nbiological function and therapeutic action. We will work in close collaboration\nwith several laboratories at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical\nSciences, UCSD, UCSD Medical School, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology\nProgram at UCSD and several US Institutions.

Siqueira-Neto (HTS core, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis,\nantivirals), Anjan Debnath (amebiasis), Carlo Ballatore and Dionicio Siegel\n(medicinal chemistry) . Nuno Bandeira and Pieter Dorrestein (NIH/NCRR Center\nfor Computational Mass Spectrometry), will help with incorporating or generating\nmass spectrometry data. We will also work on new treatments for several\ndiseases, molecular mechanisms of action, and probes for new disease related\npathways with the laboratories from UCSD Health Sciences Departments (Silvio\nGutkind, Joseph Califano, Don Durden, Nunzio Bottini, Olivier Harismendy -\noncogenomics, Pavel Pevzner, Lev Tsimring) and several US laboratories (Mark\nYeager, UVa, Irina Artsimovich, OHSU, Andrei Osterman, SBP-\nMed.Res.Institute, Eric Debler, Jefferson Uni.). Better methods, better models,\nbetter data will help with new probes for disease-related pathways, drug\nrepurposing and designing new drug combinations, understanding drug-\nresistance mutations, and understanding multi-target drug pharmacology.

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNearly half of the ~116 million Americans with hypertension are salt-sensitive and confer a 3-fold higher risk of\ndeveloping cardiovascular disease. Only 26% of hypertensive patients reach blood pressure (BP) control, which\nmay be due to lack of studies in females despite the growing evidence for sex differences in hypertensive\nmechanisms. It is known that the gut microbiota and immune system are critical in hypertension in males; this is\nlargely unknown in females. The objective of this grant is to address this knowledge gap regarding the role of\nthe gut microbiota and immune system to mediate sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension. Mechanistic\nstudies will be performed in male and female Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rats, with translational studies performed\nin samples from opposite-sex twin pairs where the males have hypertension compared to females.\nDahl SS rats, a model consistent with human salt-sensitive hypertension, exhibit a greater degree of salt-\nsensitivity and associated end-organ damage in males compared to females. We have observed stark sex\ndifferences in gut microbiota composition and gut-derived metabolites. Through microbiota transfer studies, we\nknow the gut microbiota plays a causal role in the regulation of BP and renal damage. Linking the microbiota to\nimmunity, microbiota transfer also influences renal T cell infiltration. Genetic deletion of T cells (SSCD247\u2013/\u2013)\neliminates sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension, highlighting the role of T cells to mediate BP sex\ndifferences. Since the gut microbiota influences renal T cell infiltration, and T cells amplify salt-sensitive\nhypertension, we have strong rationale for studying how sex-specific microbiota impact T cell function and salt-\nsensitivity. We will test the central hypothesis that gut microbiota-dependent T cell activation determines\nthe extent of salt-sensitive hypertension and mediates the sex differences in disease severity.\nOur hypothesis will be rigorously tested with three aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the gut microbiota\ndrives sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension. Sex-specific microbiota transfer and gonadectomy studies\nwill reveal whether the gut microbiota sex- and hormone-dependently contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension\nin SS rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the male versus female gut microbiota influences sex differences\nin T cell function and activation. Microbiota transfer in SSCD247\u2013/\u2013 rats lacking T cells will assess the impact of sex\nand gut microbiota on T cell bioenergetics and cytokine production, and will address whether T cells are required\nfor gut microbiota-dependent salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 3 will determine whether the sex-specific\nobservations in gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and T cell function in the SS rat similarly parallel humans from\na longitudinal opposite-sex twin cohort, where the males exhibit hypertension compared to their female twin pair.\nThese studies will reveal key mechanisms related to gut microbiota-immune-kidney crosstalk and provide the\npreclinical and human basis for developing novel, sex-specific targets to improve BP control and kidney disease.",

The present studies will address this significant\nknowledge gap in our understanding of sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension by investigating previously\nunrecognized gut microbiota- and immune-related mechanisms in both salt-sensitive rats and human samples,\naiding in the development of more effective, sex-specific therapeutics for the control of blood pressure and kidney\ndisease.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nIncreasing evidence suggests that the intestine plays an important role in sensing not only the presence\nof pathogens but also changes in the microbiota, which ultimately result in changes in the regulation of\nimmune pathways and behaviors by communicating with neurons. However, the complexity of the\nnervous and immune systems of mammals makes it difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which the\nneural-gut axis communicates using bidirectional signals to control intestinal immunity. Studies in the\nnematode Caenorhabditis elegans show that bacterial colonization of the intestine results in the\nactivation of the expression of innate immune genes in the gut and the activation of a neuroendocrine\nsignal that controls pathogen avoidance. The germline also plays a key role in the neural-gut axis not\nonly by transmitting the immunological memory to the next generation but also by communicating\npathogenic cues that travel from the gut to the nervous system to control innate immunity. The long-term\ngoal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which the neural-germline-gut axis communicates\nto sense pathogens and/or infection-induced physiological changes to control innate immunity at the\nwhole animal level. Thus, we will explore the general hypothesis that the neural-germline-gut axis plays\na critical role in the organismal response against bacterial pathogens by helping the nervous system\nintegrate signals from infected sites and different tissues to coordinate the immune response. Specific\ngenes and neurons will be studied to dissect the neural circuits that regulate immune activation in\nresponse to pathogen exposure and pathogen-induced alterations of the animal's physiology. A\ngenetics approach will also be used to identify neurotransmitters and endocrine signals potentially\ninvolved in the neural-immune communication that takes place between neurons and different tissues\nand infected sites.",

Increasing\nevidence indicates that gut distension caused by bacterial colonization activates a broad innate immune\nresponse.

This innate immune activation depends on inputs\nfrom the intestine that can aid in the recognition of a broad range of microbes and can modulate host\nresponses using a neural-gut axis that controls immune homeostasis. This proposal describes experiments\ndesigned to elucidate the mechanisms by which the nervous system may sense overall changes in host\nphysiology during pathogen infections and coordinate innate immune responses. Using the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans, we have demonstrated that specific genes and neurons in the nervous system of the\nanimal control immune responses, indicating that cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act\non non-neural tissues to regulate innate immune responses at the organismal level. We propose the use of a\nvariety of molecular and genetic techniques to explore the general hypothesis that alterations in host\nphysiology caused by bacterial infections trigger innate immune responses against bacterial infections that are\ncontrolled at that whole animal level by the nervous system.",

This proposal describes experiments\ndesigned to elucidate the mechanisms by which the nervous system may sense overall changes in host\nphysiology during pathogen infections and coordinate innate immune responses. Using the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans, we have demonstrated that specific genes and neurons in the nervous system of the\nanimal control immune responses, indicating that cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act\non non-neural tissues to regulate innate immune responses at the organismal level.

However, the complexity of the\nnervous and immune systems of mammals makes it difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which the\nneural-gut axis communicates using bidirectional signals to control intestinal immunity. Studies in the\nnematode Caenorhabditis elegans show that bacterial colonization of the intestine results in the\nactivation of the expression of innate immune genes in the gut and the activation of a neuroendocrine\nsignal that controls pathogen avoidance. The germline also plays a key role in the neural-gut axis not\nonly by transmitting the immunological memory to the next generation but also by communicating\npathogenic cues that travel from the gut to the nervous system to control innate immunity. The long-term\ngoal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which the neural-germline-gut axis communicates\nto sense pathogens and/or infection-induced physiological changes to control innate immunity at the\nwhole animal level. Thus, we will explore the general hypothesis that the neural-germline-gut axis plays\na critical role in the organismal response against bacterial pathogens by helping the nervous system\nintegrate signals from infected sites and different tissues to coordinate the immune response. Specific\ngenes and neurons will be studied to dissect the neural circuits that regulate immune activation in\nresponse to pathogen exposure and pathogen-induced alterations of the animal\u2019s physiology. A\ngenetics approach will also be used to identify neurotransmitters and endocrine signals potentially\ninvolved in the neural-immune communication that takes place between neurons and different tissues\nand infected sites.\nRELEVANCE (See instructions):\nThe systemic control of innate immunity is critical because inflammation accounts for the major\nphysiological, metabolic, and pathological responses to infections. We plan to continue our studies to clarify\nthe role of the nervous system in the regulation of intestinal innate immune responses against bacterial\npathogens. A better understanding of the neural-immune communication could lead to new therapeutic\ntargets for diseases involving a deficient innate immune system.",

            "abstract_text": "Increasing evidence suggests that the intestine plays an important role in sensing not only the presence\nof pathogens but also changes in the microbiota, which ultimately result in changes in the regulation of\nimmune pathways and behaviors by communicating with neurons. However, the complexity of the\nnervous and immune systems of mammals makes it difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which the\nneural-gut axis communicates using bidirectional signals to control intestinal immunity. Studies in the\nnematode Caenorhabditis elegans show that bacterial colonization of the intestine results in the\nactivation of the expression of innate immune genes in the gut and the activation of a neuroendocrine\nsignal that controls pathogen avoidance. The germline also plays a key role in the neural-gut axis not\nonly by transmitting the immunological memory to the next generation but also by communicating\npathogenic cues that travel from the gut to the nervous system to control innate immunity. The long-term\ngoal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which the neural-germline-gut axis communicates\nto sense pathogens and/or infection-induced physiological changes to control innate immunity at the\nwhole animal level. Thus, we will explore the general hypothesis that the neural-germline-gut axis plays\na critical role in the organismal response against bacterial pathogens by helping the nervous system\nintegrate signals from infected sites and different tissues to coordinate the immune response. Specific\ngenes and neurons will be studied to dissect the neural circuits that regulate immune activation in\nresponse to pathogen exposure and pathogen-induced alterations of the animal\u2019s physiology. A\ngenetics approach will also be used to identify neurotransmitters and endocrine signals potentially\ninvolved in the neural-immune communication that takes place between neurons and different tissues\nand infected sites.\nRELEVANCE (See instructions):\nThe systemic control of innate immunity is critical because inflammation accounts for the major\nphysiological, metabolic, and pathological responses to infections. We plan to continue our studies to clarify\nthe role of the nervous system in the regulation of intestinal innate immune responses against bacterial\npathogens. A better understanding of the neural-immune communication could lead to new therapeutic\ntargets for diseases involving a deficient innate immune system.",

Adult mammalian CMs have very limited proliferative potential, and\nafter myocardial infarction (MI) and the death of approximately one billion CMs, damaged cardiac tissue is\nreplaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. Significant efforts have been made to\nunderstand the proliferative capacity of CMs in mouse and zebrafish models of endogenous cardiac\nregeneration, but these efforts have not led to successful therapies. In 2018, it was shown that the neonatal\nswine heart has an endogenous capacity to robustly regenerate after cardiac injury, providing a model organism\nwhose heart is anatomically and physiologically highly similar to the human heart; therefore, investigating\nendogenous cardiac regeneration in this model organism has strong translational potential. As such, the goal of\nthis proposal is to identify novel therapeutic targets for cardiac regeneration by characterizing the molecular\nlandscape of the neonatal swine heart throughout postnatal development, endogenous regeneration, and\npathological remodeling using a novel multiomics analysis of the sarcomere, global cardiac proteome, and global\ncardiac metabolome. Aim 1 uses top-down proteomics, the premier technology to characterize proteoforms \u2013 all\nthe protein products that arise from a single gene as a result of genetic variations, alternative splicing, and post-\ntranslational modifications \u2013 to extensively characterize the molecular composition of sarcomeres that can\ndisassemble, a process that occurs during CM proliferation. These changes in sarcomere proteoform\nabundances will be correlated to developing, regenerating, and pathologically remodeling hearts to understand\nthe sarcomere composition during various biological states. Aim 2 seeks to characterize how the global\nproteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome are altered throughout postnatal swine heart development,\nregeneration, and pathological remodeling to delineate molecular mechanisms that support the regenerative\ncapacity of neonatal swine hearts. These large -omics data sets will be integrated and bioinformatically analyzed\nto holistically identify the molecular mechanisms that support myocardial regeneration in swine. The success of\nthis proposed work will elucidate novel targets for developing therapeutic strategies to promote cardiac\nregeneration in the injured human heart.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result in significant morbidity and\nhealthcare costs, especially severe exacerbations that require hospitalization. Traditional bronchodilators and anti-\ninflammatory medications, as well as programs to monitor and treat symptoms, have a modest effect on reducing\nhospital admissions. Readmission rates remain unacceptably high, so alternative approaches are needed. In this\nregard, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is remarkably effective, and is associated with an 80% reduction in admission\nrates. Successful completion of PR is also associated with substantial improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, as\nwell as exercise tolerance. Despite these benefits, recent studies have highlighted very poor referral rates for PR\noverall and as low as 1.9% post-hospitalization, and non-completion rates as high as 60%. The poor adaptation of\nPR in the community is due to a combination of barriers in availability and accessibility, as well as attrition. The\nnumber of PR centers in the United States is inadequate, and these centers are mostly distributed in urban areas.\nIn addition, multiple socioeconomic and medical barriers hinder access to PR, and contribute to high drop-out rates.\n New strategies are needed to reduce hospital readmission in COPD, and to increase the delivery of PR to\nunderserved urban as well as rural areas in the community. Given the scarcities in existing resources, conventional\nmodels of care delivery are being challenged, and attempts are being made to find alternative, cost-effective ways\nof delivering healthcare to a larger number of eligible patients. To overcome the socioeconomic and physical\nbarriers to PR, we hypothesize that a video telehealth intervention that will deliver PR to the patient's home,\nregardless of geographic location, will reduce hospital readmissions in COPD, and reduce respiratory morbidity. To\ntest our hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial comparing a\nreal-time video telehealth PR intervention plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, with the following\nSpecific Aims: (1) To determine if a video telehealth PR intervention reduces 30-day all-cause readmissions in\npatients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, (2) To evaluate the effects of the video telehealth PR\nintervention on dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge, and (3) To evaluate the\ncost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. Accomplishment of the aims of this study will result in a significant\nreduction in COPD readmission rates, and a paradigm shift in the way PR is delivered to patients with COPD,\nespecially those that reside in remote and rural areas with limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation.",

            "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nTwenty percent of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Pulmonary rehabilitation is associated with a reduction in\nhospitalization in patients with COPD, but significant barriers in availability and access limit its use. We\npropose a multicenter randomized controlled trial that will test whether a video telehealth pulmonary\nrehabilitation intervention that overcomes these barriers will reduce hospital readmissions, improve quality of\nlife, and be cost-effective.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result in significant morbidity and\nhealthcare costs, especially severe exacerbations that require hospitalization. Traditional bronchodilators and anti-\ninflammatory medications, as well as programs to monitor and treat symptoms, have a modest effect on reducing\nhospital admissions. Readmission rates remain unacceptably high, so alternative approaches are needed. In this\nregard, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is remarkably effective, and is associated with an 80% reduction in admission\nrates. Successful completion of PR is also associated with substantial improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, as\nwell as exercise tolerance. Despite these benefits, recent studies have highlighted very poor referral rates for PR\noverall and as low as 1.9% post-hospitalization, and non-completion rates as high as 60%. The poor adaptation of\nPR in the community is due to a combination of barriers in availability and accessibility, as well as attrition. The\nnumber of PR centers in the United States is inadequate, and these centers are mostly distributed in urban areas.\nIn addition, multiple socioeconomic and medical barriers hinder access to PR, and contribute to high drop-out rates.\n New strategies are needed to reduce hospital readmission in COPD, and to increase the delivery of PR to\nunderserved urban as well as rural areas in the community. Given the scarcities in existing resources, conventional\nmodels of care delivery are being challenged, and attempts are being made to find alternative, cost-effective ways\nof delivering healthcare to a larger number of eligible patients. To overcome the socioeconomic and physical\nbarriers to PR, we hypothesize that a video telehealth intervention that will deliver PR to the patient's home,\nregardless of geographic location, will reduce hospital readmissions in COPD, and reduce respiratory morbidity. To\ntest our hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial comparing a\nreal-time video telehealth PR intervention plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, with the following\nSpecific Aims: (1) To determine if a video telehealth PR intervention reduces 30-day all-cause readmissions in\npatients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, (2) To evaluate the effects of the video telehealth PR\nintervention on dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge, and (3) To evaluate the\ncost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. Accomplishment of the aims of this study will result in a significant\nreduction in COPD readmission rates, and a paradigm shift in the way PR is delivered to patients with COPD,\nespecially those that reside in remote and rural areas with limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nFracture healing is a complex bone healing process regulated by various classes of cells and signaling\nmechanisms. Of these, Wnt signaling has long been known to be critically important in directing the differentiation\nof mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts during bone healing. However, the source of these Wnt\nligands is not known. Recently, a body of literature has arisen finding both beneficial and detrimental effects of\nmacrophage-derived Wnt ligands on the regeneration of other tissues (liver, kidney, heart, and intestine), often\nby their modulation of progenitor cell behavior. As macrophages have been well-characterized as orchestrators\nof healing, their use of Wnt signaling to regulate tissue regeneration is unsurprising. However, no studies have\nyet identified the contribution of macrophages to Wnt signaling during fracture healing. Interestingly, recent\nunpublished data suggests that macrophages represent a major source of Wnt ligands during bone healing and\nunderscore the importance of macrophages in driving this process. In the work proposed here, the expression\nof Wnt ligands by macrophages will first be measured, as well as the cells targeted by Wnt ligands, during fracture\nhealing. Then, Wls, the gene encoding a necessary Wnt ligand trafficking protein, will be deleted in Csf1r-\nexpressing cells (monocytes and macrophages), inhibiting the secretion of all Wnt ligands by these cells after\ninduction of Cre recombinase with tamoxifen. Following deletion of macrophage Wls, the consequences of loss\nof macrophage-derived Wnt ligands will be characterized during the inflammatory, soft callus, and hard callus\nphases of healing. Appropriate transition through these phases, and ultimately successful healing, will be\nevaluated using qPCR, flow cytometry, micro-computed tomography, and histology. Finally, the mechanism of\nWnt trafficking to MSCs, and the consequences of their effects on MSC behavior, will be evaluated through in\nvitro co-culture experiments. The studies defined in this proposal will elucidate the importance of macrophage\nWnt ligands on bone healing and potentially identify Wnt signaling as a targetable pathway to enhance successful\nosseous healing.",

Depression is consistently and\nsignificantly associated with worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However,\nevidence-based treatments for depression in people living with HIV are rarely available in\nlow-resource settings including Zimbabwe. To address the unmet need for scalable, low-cost\nmental health care for people living with HIV, the parent grant is implementing and\nevaluating the effectiveness of the TENDAI intervention. TENDAI is a task shifted\nintervention for depression and ART adherence, suitable for delivery by non-specialists. The\neffectiveness of the task shifted intervention is tested through a 2-arm parallel group\nrandomized clinical trial. Supplementary funding is requested to fulfil the scope of work\nincluding collecting the primary outcome at 12 months post randomisation, after\nunanticipated delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPolicies at all sites in response to the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on\nparticipant recruitment. Without 290 participants followed through to the 12-month post-\nrandomisation follow-up, we will not have the sample size to deliver on the project\u2019s stated\nscope of work. In this supplemental application, we propose to ensure a total of 290\nparticipants are recruited, and all 12-month post- randomisation outcome measures are\ncollected. We will achieve this by ensuring sufficient staffing to accelerate recruitment,\ncollect all follow-up data, and conduct analyses for primary and secondary outcomes and the\neconomic evaluation manuscripts. We have implemented cost-saving strategies at all study\nsites over the previous two years and can fund the bulk of this work with our unobligated\nbalance. We are requesting additional allocation of funds to successfully complete this\ninnovative clinical trial. The results from this trial have the potential to improve lives for\npeople living with HIV at the centre of the HIV epidemic, and to advance progress towards\nthe 95 95 95 goals.",

Over the past six years, she has been engaged in clinical research, focusing on HIV-\nrelated neuroinfections in Uganda. Her long-term objective is to become an independent clinical researcher\nwith an emphasis on improving outcomes in neuroinfections. Her career development plan proposes mentored\ntraining in: 1) neurologic techniques (EEGs, neuroradiology, and neurocognitive assessment), 2) laboratory\ntechniques related to metabolomics applications, and 4) biostatistics with an emphasis of analyzing\nmetabolites in biologic samples.\n Research: Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 15% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths globally and is the most\ncommon cause of adult meningitis in Africa. Altered mental status (ranging from delirium to coma) at the time\nof cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis is consistently an independent predictor of increased mortality. Despite\nrepeated studies confirming this strong association between altered mental status and death, there is a\nfundamental lack of understanding into the exact neurological abnormalities leading to acute altered mental\nstatus, its contributions to increased mortality, and the best practices for management.\n The objective of this proposal is to identify the neurological abnormalities that contribute to altered mental\nstatus and to understand how this contributes to increased cryptococcal mortality. The overarching hypothesis\nis that cryptococcal meningitis with its increased intracranial pressure leads to cerebral hypoxia, abnormal\nelectrical activity, and biochemical changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that can be detected through\nbrain metabolite CSF analysis and enhanced clinical monitoring with cerebral oximetry and EEGs. This\nproposal aims to: 1) determine if HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting with altered\nmental status (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15) at diagnosis have measurable underlying neurological\nabnormalities and impairments in cerebral energy metabolism (i.e. insufficient oxidative metabolism) as\ncompared to persons with normal mental status (GCS=15); and 2) determine if implementation of standardized\nclinical interventions can reverse neurological abnormalities and improve cerebral energy metabolism within 3\ndays of diagnosis, and reduce 30-day mortality in HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting\nwith altered mental status (GCS<15). Results of the above aims will shed light into previously unknown\npathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to altered mental status in cryptococcal meningitis. The training in\nneuroinfections, metabolomics applications, and biostatistics that Dr. Abassi will obtain will inform future\nproposals dedicated to understanding the neuropathology of various neuroinfections and finding evidence-\nbased interventions dedicated to improving survival.",

            "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTuberculous meningitis (TBM) disproportionally affects people in low- and middle-income countries and is\nassociated with high morbidity and mortality. Stroke is a common complication in TBM and can lead to severe\nirreversible neurological disability. Studies on TBM-associated stroke pathology, however, have focused\nprimarily on HIV-uninfected individuals. The overall objective of this proposal is to use transcranial doppler and\nbrain imaging to understand changes in cerebral blood vessels and cerebral blood flow in order to determine\nchanges in cerebrovascular responsiveness, characterize patterns of stroke, and describe long-term\nneurocognitive outcomes in HIV-associated TBM. The central hypothesis is that in HIV-infected individuals,\nTBM causes extensive cerebral vascular narrowing and impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness, decreased\ncerebral blood flow, and ultimately stroke. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:\n1) describe changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness in HIV-associated TBM; 2) characterize the patterns of\nstroke in HIV-associated TBM and determine whether it is associated with vasculopathy and/or impairments in\ncerebrovascular responsiveness; and 3) determine if impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness predicts long-\nterm neurological outcome in HIV-associated TBM. Under Aim 1, transcranial doppler will be used to take\nrepeated measurements of the middle cerebral artery flow velocity and pulsatility index. A subset of study\nsubjects will also have dynamic measurements made in response to stimuli (inhaled CO2, changes in blood\npressure, and motor tasks). We will determine whether cerebrovascular responsiveness is impaired in HIV-\nassociated TBM by comparing measurements to those of control patients with no neurological infection. Under\nAim 2, all study subjects will have a brain MRI performed within the first 2-weeks of TBM treatment to identify\nthe presence of a cerebral artery stroke and the associated cerebral artery territory. We will compare TCD\nreadings between participants with or without stroke. Under Aim 3, we will examine how TCD measurements at\nstudy enrolment relate to the results of neurocognitive testing at month 2 and functional assessment at month\n6. Ultimately, the long-term goal of the proposal is to describe how impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness in\nHIV-associated TBM contributes to the development of strokes and resulting neurocognitive impairment and\ndisability. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it incorporates the use of\ntranscranial doppler at the bedside, to be used in real time, in the care of subjects with TBM. The proposed\nresearch is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for the development of\nfuture clinical trials testing targeted interventions to improve cerebrovascular responsiveness and prevent the\ndevelopment of strokes in HIV-associated TBM. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of preventing the\ndevelopment of irreversible neurological injury and improving both short and long-term outcomes.",

            "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTuberculous meningitis (TBM) disproportionally affects people in low- and middle-income countries and is\nassociated with high morbidity and mortality. Stroke is a common complication in TBM and can lead to severe\nirreversible neurological disability. Studies on TBM-associated stroke pathology, however, have focused\nprimarily on HIV-uninfected individuals. The overall objective of this proposal is to use transcranial doppler and\nbrain imaging to understand changes in cerebral blood vessels and cerebral blood flow in order to determine\nchanges in cerebrovascular responsiveness, characterize patterns of stroke, and describe long-term\nneurocognitive outcomes in HIV-associated TBM. The central hypothesis is that in HIV-infected individuals,\nTBM causes extensive cerebral vascular narrowing and impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness, decreased\ncerebral blood flow, and ultimately stroke. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:\n1) describe changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness in HIV-associated TBM; 2) characterize the patterns of\nstroke in HIV-associated TBM and determine whether it is associated with vasculopathy and/or impairments in\ncerebrovascular responsiveness; and 3) determine if impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness predicts long-\nterm neurological outcome in HIV-associated TBM. Under Aim 1, transcranial doppler will be used to take\nrepeated measurements of the middle cerebral artery flow velocity and pulsatility index. A subset of study\nsubjects will also have dynamic measurements made in response to stimuli (inhaled CO2, changes in blood\npressure, and motor tasks). We will determine whether cerebrovascular responsiveness is impaired in HIV-\nassociated TBM by comparing measurements to those of control patients with no neurological infection. Under\nAim 2, all study subjects will have a brain MRI performed within the first 2-weeks of TBM treatment to identify\nthe presence of a cerebral artery stroke and the associated cerebral artery territory. We will compare TCD\nreadings between participants with or without stroke. Under Aim 3, we will examine how TCD measurements at\nstudy enrolment relate to the results of neurocognitive testing at month 2 and functional assessment at month\n6. Ultimately, the long-term goal of the proposal is to describe how impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness in\nHIV-associated TBM contributes to the development of strokes and resulting neurocognitive impairment and\ndisability. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it incorporates the use of\ntranscranial doppler at the bedside, to be used in real time, in the care of subjects with TBM. The proposed\nresearch is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for the development of\nfuture clinical trials testing targeted interventions to improve cerebrovascular responsiveness and prevent the\ndevelopment of strokes in HIV-associated TBM. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of preventing the\ndevelopment of irreversible neurological injury and improving both short and long-term outcomes.",

Once the mechanism leading to strokes in\nTBM is understood, there is the protentional for the development of targeted interventions to reduce the\nincidence of strokes in HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to\nNINDS\u2019 mission pertaining to the reduction of long-term neurological disability in neuroinfections.",

Over the past six years, she has been engaged in clinical research, focusing on HIV-\nrelated neuroinfections in Uganda. Her long-term objective is to become an independent clinical researcher\nwith an emphasis on improving outcomes in neuroinfections. Her career development plan proposes mentored\ntraining in: 1) neurologic techniques (EEGs, neuroradiology, and neurocognitive assessment), 2) laboratory\ntechniques related to metabolomics applications, and 4) biostatistics with an emphasis of analyzing\nmetabolites in biologic samples.\n Research: Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 15% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths globally and is the most\ncommon cause of adult meningitis in Africa. Altered mental status (ranging from delirium to coma) at the time\nof cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis is consistently an independent predictor of increased mortality. Despite\nrepeated studies confirming this strong association between altered mental status and death, there is a\nfundamental lack of understanding into the exact neurological abnormalities leading to acute altered mental\nstatus, its contributions to increased mortality, and the best practices for management.\n The objective of this proposal is to identify the neurological abnormalities that contribute to altered mental\nstatus and to understand how this contributes to increased cryptococcal mortality. The overarching hypothesis\nis that cryptococcal meningitis with its increased intracranial pressure leads to cerebral hypoxia, abnormal\nelectrical activity, and biochemical changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that can be detected through\nbrain metabolite CSF analysis and enhanced clinical monitoring with cerebral oximetry and EEGs. This\nproposal aims to: 1) determine if HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting with altered\nmental status (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15) at diagnosis have measurable underlying neurological\nabnormalities and impairments in cerebral energy metabolism (i.e. insufficient oxidative metabolism) as\ncompared to persons with normal mental status (GCS=15); and 2) determine if implementation of standardized\nclinical interventions can reverse neurological abnormalities and improve cerebral energy metabolism within 3\ndays of diagnosis, and reduce 30-day mortality in HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting\nwith altered mental status (GCS<15). Results of the above aims will shed light into previously unknown\npathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to altered mental status in cryptococcal meningitis. The training in\nneuroinfections, metabolomics applications, and biostatistics that Dr. Abassi will obtain will inform future\nproposals dedicated to understanding the neuropathology of various neuroinfections and finding evidence-\nbased interventions dedicated to improving survival.",

Moreover, conventional single-cell\nmethods require sequencing prohibitively large numbers of cells to characterize rare subsets. Here we will\ndevelop and apply SEARCH-seq, a high-throughput cytometry method that detects RNA or DNA markers with\nsingle molecule sensitivity that allows the rapid isolation of target cells for in-depth transcriptomic, genomic, or\nepigenomic analyses. We will use the method to study the regulatory mechanisms controlling an astrocyte\nsubpopulation characterized by an alternatively spliced XBP1 transcript, which promotes disease pathology in\nmultiple sclerosis (MS). This subpopulation also manifests in the pre-clinical mouse model of experimental\nautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using SEARCH-seq in combination with conditional knock-out mice, in\nvivo CRISPR/Cas9-driven perturbation studies, and RNA-seq analyses of mouse EAE and human MS samples,\nwe will characterize the role of these cells and their interaction with the nuclear receptor NR3C2 and its\ncorepressor NCOR2 in limiting XBP1-driven pathogenic astrocyte responses. In summary, SEARCH-seq is a\nnovel, sensitive, and high throughput method to capture rare brain cell subsets that are difficult to study with\nexisting technology and may have therapeutically targetable mechanisms relevant to MS pathogenesis.",

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nInfections by different pathogens can manifest with similar symptoms, but appropriate treatment requires specific\nand accurate diagnosis. Clinicians often turn to multiplexed assays testing for many organisms (e.g. BioFire).\nWhile these approaches can test for 50-70 organisms, they do not provide concentration titers, which is\nnecessary to identify the causative pathogen among the several false positives or clinically meaningless\ncommensals. As a result, the clinician must perform additional tests to identify which of the positives is causative.\nAlthough these tests use quantitative PCR, in clinical labs the results are reported as presence/absence due to\nthe finicky nature of PCR in this setting, which is sensitive to minor variations in reaction efficiency, operator\nvariability. As a result, today, only a few widespread PCR tests are FDA approved to report quantitative result.\nIn contrast to qPCR, digital PCR (dPCR) measures target titers by counting individual molecules. As a result,\ndPCR provides an absolute concentration measurement that doesn\u2019t require a standard curve. In addition, the\nreaction is cycled to endpoint, then quantified; it does not require careful estimation of the amplification rate,\nwhich is a major source of variability in qPCR. Thus, dPCR is less sensitive to variations in reaction efficiency\nand provides superior consistency. However, current dPCR methods are limited in multiplexing, allowing just 5-\n6 targets per assay, while qPCR can test up to 100. Moreover, dPCR requires complex microfluidic equipment\nthat burdens testing lab personnel and increases cost. Until these issues can be addressed, qPCR will continue\nto dominate the clinical lab, and quantitative and absolute pathogen load reporting will remain beyond reach.\nHere, we propose a novel nucleic acid technology combining the quantitativeness and robustness of dPCR with\nthe simplicity and multiplexing of qPCR. Our vision is to enable broad spectrum detection wherein each pathogen\nis associated with a high confidence, quantitative titer. Our approach \u2013 gigapixel PCR (gPCR) \u2013 is enabled by\nour recent discoveries of self-assembled partitioning, for microfluidic-free generation of monodispersed\nemulsions, and linearized target quantitation with capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE allows sensitive quantitation\nover 7 decades and provides amplicon length information with single nucleotide resolution. In gPCR, we use this\nto perform multiplexed detection of over 100 amplicons per reaction. In contrast to qPCR, which requires that\nthe sample be split to test for different targets, thereby diluting it and reducing sensitivity, with gPCR the targets\nare tested without splitting, maintaining them at maximal concentration, and substantially increasing sensitivity.\nMoreover, based on robust dPCR, gPCR provides reproducible, quantitative results across testing conditions. It\nthus addresses the major limitations of current dPCR technologies and provides the first viable alternative to\nqPCR in the clinic. We will develop and validate the technology against accepted standards (SeraCare), and\nwork with our longstanding collaborators (Drs. Melanie Ott and Charles Chiu) to apply it to respiratory and CNS\ninfections from samples previously collected at UCSF hospitals.",

However, shared symptoms among different infections and the emergence of drug resistance make\ndiagnosis and treatment selection challenging. In this competing renewal, we propose to develop Gigapixel NGS\n(gNGS) to enable rapid, sensitive, and information-rich infectious disease diagnosis. gNGS builds upon our\nGigapixel PCR (gPCR) technology by incorporating powerful next-generation sequencing capabilities. By\nutilizing double emulsion vesicles for single cell assays, gNGS eliminates the need for specialized droplet\nanalyzers and allows common flow cytometers to be used for genome isolation.\nOur goal in this renewal is to leverage the capabilities of Gigapixel NGS to detect, isolate, and sequence\ninfectious pathogen genomes from patient samples, which will improve the efficiency and sensitivity of pathogen\nsequencing. We will collaborate with Dr. Charles Chiu, a renowned expert in infectious disease diagnostics who\nleads the CLIA-certified pathogen lab at UCSF, to develop clinical workflows and bioinformatic tools for\ninterrogating the recovered genomes for relevant biomarker sequences, including virulence factors and drug\nresistance genes. Dr. Chiu's expertise in infectious disease diagnostics and practical experience in clinical\nsample sequencing for pathogen detection will ensure that the new diagnostic is effective and practical in a\nclinical setting.",

Moreover, conventional single-cell\nmethods require sequencing prohibitively large numbers of cells to characterize rare subsets. Here we will\ndevelop and apply SEARCH-seq, a high-throughput cytometry method that detects RNA or DNA markers with\nsingle molecule sensitivity that allows the rapid isolation of target cells for in-depth transcriptomic, genomic, or\nepigenomic analyses. We will use the method to study the regulatory mechanisms controlling an astrocyte\nsubpopulation characterized by an alternatively spliced XBP1 transcript, which promotes disease pathology in\nmultiple sclerosis (MS). This subpopulation also manifests in the pre-clinical mouse model of experimental\nautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using SEARCH-seq in combination with conditional knock-out mice, in\nvivo CRISPR/Cas9-driven perturbation studies, and RNA-seq analyses of mouse EAE and human MS samples,\nwe will characterize the role of these cells and their interaction with the nuclear receptor NR3C2 and its\ncorepressor NCOR2 in limiting XBP1-driven pathogenic astrocyte responses. In summary, SEARCH-seq is a\nnovel, sensitive, and high throughput method to capture rare brain cell subsets that are difficult to study with\nexisting technology and may have therapeutically targetable mechanisms relevant to MS pathogenesis.",

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nEmbryos cultured external to the body are exposed to non-physiologic conditions that can impair the health of\nthe future adult. Moreover, culture stress reduces immediate embryo viability and implantation success,\nmotivating multiple embryo transfers and leading to high rates of multiple pregnancies. These pregnancies are\nrisky for fetus and mother and exhibit a high healthcare cost burden. To address this, embryos are screened\nbased on early-stage morphology to identify the healthiest for transfer, but this approach achieves limited\nsuccess and is highly dependent on the individual conducting the test. An accurate and objective screening\nmethod would increase implantation rates and reduce the need for multiple transfers, in addition to yielding\nhealthier offspring. The objective of this project is to develop a new technology for noninvasive IVF embryo\nselection. Dr. Paolo Rinaudo, Co-I on this grant, is a Reproductive Endocrinologist working at the UCSF Center\nfor Reproductive Health which performs >2000 IVF procedures per year and has commitment to research.\nThrough experience derived from two decades of work in IVF, he identified that current methods for screening\nembryos are inadequate, with the gold standard, morphological selection, achieving a positive predictive value\nof just 30%. While an embryo may appear morphologically healthy, it may not be molecularly healthy, which may\naffect the long-term development of the fetus. Among his two decades of research on cultured embryos and IVF\nis the finding that ex vivo culture can stress embryos and drive Warburg-like metabolism. In addition, culture\nstress has now been correlated to long-term negative health outcomes, including abnormal placental\ndevelopment, metabolic dysfunction, hypertension, and diabetes. Dr. Rinaudo hypothesized that metabolically\nactive embryos lower their culture droplet pH, similar to how Warburg metabolism acidifies the environment\naround cancer cells, thereby affording a simple way to select the best embryos for transfer. His research has\nconfirmed this, but the technique cannot be translated to practice because there is no effective and reliable pH\nmeasuring method for the culture droplet due to its tiny volume. Armed with this concept, he reached out to Dr.\nAdam Abate, a physicist and engineer at UCSF. Dr. Abate is a leader in microfluidics and nanotechnology with\na record of developing and translating health care technologies to practice, having founded multiple companies\ncommercializing his inventions, including Fluent Biosciences (genomics), Mission Bio (oncology diagnostics) and\nScribe (cell & gene therapy). Together, Drs. Rinaudo and Abate have designed a novel hydrogel biosensor that\nnon-invasively measures culture droplet pH. Being an IVF clinician, Dr. Rinaudo is aware of the regulatory and\npractical constraints of IVF operations and thus ensured the design is feasible for this setting by making it simple,\nnon-invasive, and cost-effective. This grant will develop the technology and validate its efficacy in a mouse model\nof IVF, providing critical data for a follow-on R01. The project is thus based on a rigorous scientific foundation,\ndecades of clinical experience, and comprises a team capable of translating science discoveries to the clinic.",

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nEmbryos cultured external to the body are exposed to non-physiologic conditions that can impair the health of\nthe future adult. Moreover, culture stress reduces immediate embryo viability and implantation success,\nmotivating multiple embryo transfers and leading to high rates of multiple pregnancies. These pregnancies are\nrisky for fetus and mother and exhibit a high healthcare cost burden. To address this, embryos are screened\nbased on early-stage morphology to identify the healthiest for transfer, but this approach achieves limited\nsuccess and is highly dependent on the individual conducting the test. An accurate and objective screening\nmethod would increase implantation rates and reduce the need for multiple transfers, in addition to yielding\nhealthier offspring. The objective of this project is to develop a new technology for noninvasive IVF embryo\nselection. Dr. Paolo Rinaudo, Co-I on this grant, is a Reproductive Endocrinologist working at the UCSF Center\nfor Reproductive Health which performs >2000 IVF procedures per year and has commitment to research.\nThrough experience derived from two decades of work in IVF, he identified that current methods for screening\nembryos are inadequate, with the gold standard, morphological selection, achieving a positive predictive value\nof just 30%. While an embryo may appear morphologically healthy, it may not be molecularly healthy, which may\naffect the long-term development of the fetus. Among his two decades of research on cultured embryos and IVF\nis the finding that ex vivo culture can stress embryos and drive Warburg-like metabolism. In addition, culture\nstress has now been correlated to long-term negative health outcomes, including abnormal placental\ndevelopment, metabolic dysfunction, hypertension, and diabetes. Dr. Rinaudo hypothesized that metabolically\nactive embryos lower their culture droplet pH, similar to how Warburg metabolism acidifies the environment\naround cancer cells, thereby affording a simple way to select the best embryos for transfer. His research has\nconfirmed this, but the technique cannot be translated to practice because there is no effective and reliable pH\nmeasuring method for the culture droplet due to its tiny volume. Armed with this concept, he reached out to Dr.\nAdam Abate, a physicist and engineer at UCSF. Dr. Abate is a leader in microfluidics and nanotechnology with\na record of developing and translating health care technologies to practice, having founded multiple companies\ncommercializing his inventions, including Fluent Biosciences (genomics), Mission Bio (oncology diagnostics) and\nScribe (cell & gene therapy). Together, Drs. Rinaudo and Abate have designed a novel hydrogel biosensor that\nnon-invasively measures culture droplet pH. Being an IVF clinician, Dr. Rinaudo is aware of the regulatory and\npractical constraints of IVF operations and thus ensured the design is feasible for this setting by making it simple,\nnon-invasive, and cost-effective. This grant will develop the technology and validate its efficacy in a mouse model\nof IVF, providing critical data for a follow-on R01. The project is thus based on a rigorous scientific foundation,\ndecades of clinical experience, and comprises a team capable of translating science discoveries to the clinic.",

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nInfections by different pathogens can manifest with similar symptoms, but appropriate treatment requires specific\nand accurate diagnosis. Clinicians often turn to multiplexed assays testing for many organisms (e.g. BioFire).\nWhile these approaches can test for 50-70 organisms, they do not provide concentration titers, which is\nnecessary to identify the causative pathogen among the several false positives or clinically meaningless\ncommensals. As a result, the clinician must perform additional tests to identify which of the positives is causative.\nAlthough these tests use quantitative PCR, in clinical labs the results are reported as presence/absence due to\nthe finicky nature of PCR in this setting, which is sensitive to minor variations in reaction efficiency, operator\nvariability. As a result, today, only a few widespread PCR tests are FDA approved to report quantitative result.\nIn contrast to qPCR, digital PCR (dPCR) measures target titers by counting individual molecules. As a result,\ndPCR provides an absolute concentration measurement that doesn\u2019t require a standard curve. In addition, the\nreaction is cycled to endpoint, then quantified; it does not require careful estimation of the amplification rate,\nwhich is a major source of variability in qPCR. Thus, dPCR is less sensitive to variations in reaction efficiency\nand provides superior consistency. However, current dPCR methods are limited in multiplexing, allowing just 5-\n6 targets per assay, while qPCR can test up to 100. Moreover, dPCR requires complex microfluidic equipment\nthat burdens testing lab personnel and increases cost. Until these issues can be addressed, qPCR will continue\nto dominate the clinical lab, and quantitative and absolute pathogen load reporting will remain beyond reach.\nHere, we propose a novel nucleic acid technology combining the quantitativeness and robustness of dPCR with\nthe simplicity and multiplexing of qPCR. Our vision is to enable broad spectrum detection wherein each pathogen\nis associated with a high confidence, quantitative titer. Our approach \u2013 gigapixel PCR (gPCR) \u2013 is enabled by\nour recent discoveries of self-assembled partitioning, for microfluidic-free generation of monodispersed\nemulsions, and linearized target quantitation with capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE allows sensitive quantitation\nover 7 decades and provides amplicon length information with single nucleotide resolution. In gPCR, we use this\nto perform multiplexed detection of over 100 amplicons per reaction. In contrast to qPCR, which requires that\nthe sample be split to test for different targets, thereby diluting it and reducing sensitivity, with gPCR the targets\nare tested without splitting, maintaining them at maximal concentration, and substantially increasing sensitivity.\nMoreover, based on robust dPCR, gPCR provides reproducible, quantitative results across testing conditions. It\nthus addresses the major limitations of current dPCR technologies and provides the first viable alternative to\nqPCR in the clinic. We will develop and validate the technology against accepted standards (SeraCare), and\nwork with our longstanding collaborators (Drs. Melanie Ott and Charles Chiu) to apply it to respiratory and CNS\ninfections from samples previously collected at UCSF hospitals.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are mainly expressed by NK cells, although their\nexpression has also been described in CD4+, CD8+ and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Within CD8 T cells, KIR expression is\ninduced at later stages of lymphocyte maturation and is thought to regulate specific T cell effector functions.\nWithin KIR receptors, KIR2DL2 modulates T cell effector functions, as KIR2DL2+ CD8+ T cells present\nreduced level of activation-induced cell death, and poor IFN-\u03b3 secretion after T cell receptor (TCR)\nstimulation. The notion of a suppressive function of KIR2DL2 expression in CD8+ T cells is supported by the\nobservation that patients that express its cognate ligand, HLA-C1, showed decreased overall survival and\ncould not control tumor growth. Our preliminary data show that KIR2DL2 expression increases in vivo in\nadoptively transferred T cells in patients and in preclinical models of adoptive immunotherapy. Using a\npancreatic tumor model, we found that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells expressing KIR2DL2 were\nsignificantly less cytotoxic than their KIR2DL2- counterparts in presence of KIR2DL2\u2019s ligand. Furthermore,\nKIR2DL2 expression in CAR-T cells was associated with reduced antitumor efficacy, in an HLA-I-dependent\nmanner, in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. Based on these preliminary findings we hypothesize that\nKIR2DL2 behaves as a T cell immune checkpoint, modulating T cell effector function and leading to\nan ineffective immunosurveillance. Therefore, targeting KIR2DL2 during T cell manufacturing may\nimprove T cell performance after cell infusion. We will test our hypothesis by 1) Defining the modulatory\nmechanisms whereby KIR2DL2 shapes CAR- and TCR-transgenic T cell antitumoral effector function. We\nwill determine the overall effect of KIR2DL2 engagement in TCR-transgenic and CAR-T cell effector function.\nAdditionally, we will determine which regions within KIR2DL2 are responsible for its modulatory function.\nFinally, we will characterize both the KIR2DL2 signaling interactome and the downstream events triggered\nby its ligand interaction by immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses. 2) Improving T cell performance for\nthe enhancement of adoptive cell immunotherapies (ACTs) by abrogating KIR2DL2 function. To prevent its\ninhibitory effect, manipulation of KIR2DL2 expression and/or signaling will be conducted and adapted to the\ncurrent protocols for CAR-T cell manufacturing. Based on the anticipated results, we will link for the first time\nthe biological and molecular function of KIR2DL2 within therapeutic T cells. The proposed studies will\nincrease our mechanistic understanding of KIR2DL2 biology and will generate novel cell products with high\ntranslational potential.",

            "abstract_text": "While immunotherapies have made strides in the treatment of other cancers, castrate resistant prostate cancer\n(CRPC) remains largely unresponsive, underscoring the need for novel approaches. One such approach relies\non the administration of autologous T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\nthat recognize specific tumor-associated antigens. Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is widely expressed in\nprostate cancer and we have previously developed a CAR targeting PSCA that has potent in vivo efficacy. To\ntarget bone metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), we propose to manipulate a specific subset of T cells, called \u03b3\u03b4 that\ncan be driven to the skeleton via systemic treatment with bisphosphonates such as zoledronate (ZOL) that is\nclinically used to limit cancer-induced bone disease in men with bone mCRPC. Importantly, ZOL treatment\ninduces accumulation of phosphoantigens in tumor cells, which are detected by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Our preliminary\nfindings show that ZOL can enhance \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells' homing to bone where they can prevent cancer growth via\nCAR and via endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T treatment, in presence or absence of\nZOL, can mitigate cancer-induced bone deterioration. Moreover, we found that soluble factors secreted by\nbone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can increase the cytotoxic potential of \u03b3\u03b4 CART cells.\nFinally, we found that the choice of CAR structural and costimulatory moieties affects the phenotype and\nfuction \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells differentially, requiring the design of CARs optimized for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Based on these\npreliminary findings we hypothesize that the homing and cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T cells for the\ntreatment of bone metastatic CRPC can be greatly enhanced through genetic, pharmacological, and\nmicroenvironmental approaches. We will test our hypothesis by; 1) Defining the optimum \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T design\nthat will significantly enhance CRPC cytotoxicity. We will test the biological implications of choosing alternative\nCAR transmembrane and costimulatory domains, with a specific focus on their ability to modulate the\nexpression of cytokine receptors. We will also dissect the specific signaling pathways that can govern \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-\nT cell persistence. Finally, we will identify the molecular signaling pathways triggered by CARs with different\ncostimulatory domains. 2) Determining if ZOL can drive \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T recruitment and anti-bone mCRPC activity in\nvivo. We will use xenograft and PDX models of bone mCRPC to characterize the bioavailability and therapeutic\nefficacy of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T + ZOL; and an immunocompetent model to map sites of phosphoantigen accumulation.\n3) Dissecting the reciprocal effects of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T on the bone mCRPC microenvironment. We will analyze the\nimpact of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T + ZOL treatment on the structure and physiology of the bone, and the effects of MSC on\nthe performance of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T cells in vivo. Based on the anticipated results, characterizing the specific\nproperties of the bone/tumor microenvironment will reveal novel insights thereby providing a strong rationale\nfor the translation of immunotherapies tailored to eliminate currently incurable bone mCRPC.",

            "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nAdvanced prostate cancer remains an incurable disease that often colonizes the skeleton, causing bone\ndestruction and pain. Drugs used to mitigate bone destruction can induce changes in bone metastatic prostate\ncancer cells that, in turn, attract and activate specific immune cells (\u03b3\u03b4 T cells). Based on this observation, we\npropose to study 1) how prostate cancer cells and bone microenvironmental cells namely, mesenchymal\nstromal cells (MSCs), affect the activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; 2) how \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be manipulated to make them more\neffective cancer killers by introducing cancer-specific chimeric antigen receptors; and 3) how \u03b3\u03b4 T cells modify\nthe bone microenvironment response; with the long-term goal of developing novel and more effective\nimmunotherapies for prostate cancer.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY \nCELL THERAPIES CORE \nThe Cell Therapies Core (CTC) enables research, development and manufacturing of human cells for use in \npatients undergoing cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. CTC manufactures cell products that support \nnovel, investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs), while maintaining compliance with standards set by the Food \nand Drug Administration, the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapies, and by other accrediting \nbodies. CTC supports Members in all stages of clinical trial development, and execution, including \ncollaborative work enabling investigational new drug filing, development and validation of manufacturing \nprocesses, and quality control assays for clinical release, as well as full scale clinical manufacturing for \npatients on clinical trials. CTC also aids Members in drafting and submitting cell therapy-related grants or \ncontracts. CTC supports Members by organizing its activities into four Specific Aims: \nAim 1: To develop new technologies for translation of cellular therapies. \nAim 2: To provide regulatory assistance in support of cellular therapies. \nAim 3: To produce the highest quality cellular products for immunotherapy clinical trials. \nAim 4: To educate and train scientists and clinicians committed to careers in cellular therapies. \nCTC has significantly contributed to high impact research of FDA-approved IITs by providing dendritic cell and \ntumor cell-based vaccines, gene-modified stem and progenitor cells, T regulatory cells, natural killer cells, \ntumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Since 2016, CTC Member \nusage has increased by 63%. Specifically, CTC has supported 26 Members (67% peer reviewed) across three \nCCSG Programs (MM 24%, HOB 3%, IO 73%), resulting in support of 53 protocols (a 96% increase since \n2016) and the manufacture of 450 cellular products. Together, this Member activity represented 97% of all \nCTC usage over the last reporting period. The expertise of CTC is consistent with its mission to fully support \nclinical trials evaluating ex vivo selection and expansion of cells, transgene expression, stem cell engineering, \nand genetic strategies that augment immunity and/or effectively treat solid and hematologic cancers. To \nmaximize CTC\u2019s capacity to meet projected Member needs over the next five years, CTC is expanding its \nphysical footprint, adding 8,300-ft2 of space that will enable CTC to provide automated, closed-system \nmanufacturing of cellular products in a class 100,000 space, and to increase manufacturing capacity in its \ncurrent class 10,000 laboratory spaces. Furthermore, CTC will expand its repertoire of unique services to also \ninclude the generation of viral vectors necessary for the development of cell-based therapies, such as CAR-T \nand TIL based therapies, reducing a critical developmental bottleneck and meeting Member needs.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are mainly expressed by NK cells, although their\nexpression has also been described in CD4+, CD8+ and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Within CD8 T cells, KIR expression is\ninduced at later stages of lymphocyte maturation and is thought to regulate specific T cell effector functions.\nWithin KIR receptors, KIR2DL2 modulates T cell effector functions, as KIR2DL2+ CD8+ T cells present\nreduced level of activation-induced cell death, and poor IFN-\u03b3 secretion after T cell receptor (TCR)\nstimulation. The notion of a suppressive function of KIR2DL2 expression in CD8+ T cells is supported by the\nobservation that patients that express its cognate ligand, HLA-C1, showed decreased overall survival and\ncould not control tumor growth. Our preliminary data show that KIR2DL2 expression increases in vivo in\nadoptively transferred T cells in patients and in preclinical models of adoptive immunotherapy. Using a\npancreatic tumor model, we found that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells expressing KIR2DL2 were\nsignificantly less cytotoxic than their KIR2DL2- counterparts in presence of KIR2DL2\u2019s ligand. Furthermore,\nKIR2DL2 expression in CAR-T cells was associated with reduced antitumor efficacy, in an HLA-I-dependent\nmanner, in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. Based on these preliminary findings we hypothesize that\nKIR2DL2 behaves as a T cell immune checkpoint, modulating T cell effector function and leading to\nan ineffective immunosurveillance. Therefore, targeting KIR2DL2 during T cell manufacturing may\nimprove T cell performance after cell infusion. We will test our hypothesis by 1) Defining the modulatory\nmechanisms whereby KIR2DL2 shapes CAR- and TCR-transgenic T cell antitumoral effector function. We\nwill determine the overall effect of KIR2DL2 engagement in TCR-transgenic and CAR-T cell effector function.\nAdditionally, we will determine which regions within KIR2DL2 are responsible for its modulatory function.\nFinally, we will characterize both the KIR2DL2 signaling interactome and the downstream events triggered\nby its ligand interaction by immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses. 2) Improving T cell performance for\nthe enhancement of adoptive cell immunotherapies (ACTs) by abrogating KIR2DL2 function. To prevent its\ninhibitory effect, manipulation of KIR2DL2 expression and/or signaling will be conducted and adapted to the\ncurrent protocols for CAR-T cell manufacturing. Based on the anticipated results, we will link for the first time\nthe biological and molecular function of KIR2DL2 within therapeutic T cells. The proposed studies will\nincrease our mechanistic understanding of KIR2DL2 biology and will generate novel cell products with high\ntranslational potential.",

            "abstract_text": "While immunotherapies have made strides in the treatment of other cancers, castrate resistant prostate cancer\n(CRPC) remains largely unresponsive, underscoring the need for novel approaches. One such approach relies\non the administration of autologous T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\nthat recognize specific tumor-associated antigens. Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is widely expressed in\nprostate cancer and we have previously developed a CAR targeting PSCA that has potent in vivo efficacy. To\ntarget bone metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), we propose to manipulate a specific subset of T cells, called \u03b3\u03b4 that\ncan be driven to the skeleton via systemic treatment with bisphosphonates such as zoledronate (ZOL) that is\nclinically used to limit cancer-induced bone disease in men with bone mCRPC. Importantly, ZOL treatment\ninduces accumulation of phosphoantigens in tumor cells, which are detected by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Our preliminary\nfindings show that ZOL can enhance \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells' homing to bone where they can prevent cancer growth via\nCAR and via endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T treatment, in presence or absence of\nZOL, can mitigate cancer-induced bone deterioration. Moreover, we found that soluble factors secreted by\nbone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can increase the cytotoxic potential of \u03b3\u03b4 CART cells.\nFinally, we found that the choice of CAR structural and costimulatory moieties affects the phenotype and\nfuction \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells differentially, requiring the design of CARs optimized for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Based on these\npreliminary findings we hypothesize that the homing and cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T cells for the\ntreatment of bone metastatic CRPC can be greatly enhanced through genetic, pharmacological, and\nmicroenvironmental approaches. We will test our hypothesis by; 1) Defining the optimum \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T design\nthat will significantly enhance CRPC cytotoxicity. We will test the biological implications of choosing alternative\nCAR transmembrane and costimulatory domains, with a specific focus on their ability to modulate the\nexpression of cytokine receptors. We will also dissect the specific signaling pathways that can govern \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-\nT cell persistence. Finally, we will identify the molecular signaling pathways triggered by CARs with different\ncostimulatory domains. 2) Determining if ZOL can drive \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T recruitment and anti-bone mCRPC activity in\nvivo. We will use xenograft and PDX models of bone mCRPC to characterize the bioavailability and therapeutic\nefficacy of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T + ZOL; and an immunocompetent model to map sites of phosphoantigen accumulation.\n3) Dissecting the reciprocal effects of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T on the bone mCRPC microenvironment. We will analyze the\nimpact of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T + ZOL treatment on the structure and physiology of the bone, and the effects of MSC on\nthe performance of \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T cells in vivo. Based on the anticipated results, characterizing the specific\nproperties of the bone/tumor microenvironment will reveal novel insights thereby providing a strong rationale\nfor the translation of immunotherapies tailored to eliminate currently incurable bone mCRPC.",

            "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nAdvanced prostate cancer remains an incurable disease that often colonizes the skeleton, causing bone\ndestruction and pain. Drugs used to mitigate bone destruction can induce changes in bone metastatic prostate\ncancer cells that, in turn, attract and activate specific immune cells (\u03b3\u03b4 T cells). Based on this observation, we\npropose to study 1) how prostate cancer cells and bone microenvironmental cells namely, mesenchymal\nstromal cells (MSCs), affect the activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; 2) how \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be manipulated to make them more\neffective cancer killers by introducing cancer-specific chimeric antigen receptors; and 3) how \u03b3\u03b4 T cells modify\nthe bone microenvironment response; with the long-term goal of developing novel and more effective\nimmunotherapies for prostate cancer.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Advanced prostate cancer represents a major cause of cancer death in men, usually as a consequence\nof treatment failure, which gives rise to aggressive disease variants that are highly metastatic. Among the major\nbiological processes that are causally dysregulated in advanced prostate cancer are those related to DNA repair.\nNotably, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are among the most frequently altered DNA repair genes in advanced prostate\ncancer, and are also key targets for its treatment. To study their functions in prostate cancer, we have generated\ngenetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) based on inducible loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in the\nprostate. In preliminary studies, we have found that loss-of-function of Brca2 results in aggressive prostate\ntumors with highly penetrant metastases, including to bone, that are coincident with increased DNA damage and\naccelerated by androgen deprivation. In parallel, we have developed computational tools to elucidate the\nmolecular determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 functions in prostate cancer. We have also developed a new\nprecision oncology platform called OncoLoop, to computationally match individual patients to individual GEMMs,\nand to predict and validate drugs that target specific patient-GEMM pairs.\n Leveraging these models and resources, we will systematically investigate the functions of BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 in prostate cancer, guided by the hypothesis that defective DNA repair plays an important role in\nprostate cancer progression and treatment, particularly in the context of androgen deprivation. In Aim 1, we will\ninvestigate the consequences of loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoid\nmodels, and patient-derived human organoid models for prostate tumorigenesis, metastasis, and DNA damage\nresponse. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate\ncancer and elucidate the relationship of DNA repair mechanisms for disease progression. In Aim 2, we will\ninvestigate molecular determinants of DNA repair functions in prostate cancer by identifying and functionally\ncharacterizing master regulators (MRs) that represent mechanistic determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 loss-of-\nfunction in prostate tumors and metastases. MRs will be prioritized based on conservation with human prostate\ncancer, and functionally validated in mouse and human organoids. We will complement these studies by\nanalyses of tumors and metastases using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify MR signatures\nassociated with specific cell states. In Aim 3, we will leverage our GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoids and\nallografts, and patient-derived organotypic models to pursue co-clinical investigations of DNA repair function in\nprostate cancer. In Aim 3A, we will systematically evaluate drugs/drug combinations currently in or advancing\nto clinical practice. In Aim 3B, we will use the OncoLoop platform to predict new drugs that target DNA repair in\nprostate-specific contexts. Overall, these studies will provide biological and molecular insights to inform on\ncurrent trials and to support the development of future ones.",

Our investigations have now revealed that NKX3.1 defends prostate cells\nfrom oxidative stress by regulating gene expression in both the nucleus and mitochondria. We find that, in\naddition to its expected functions as a transcriptional factor in the nucleus, NKX3.1 also localizes to\nmitochondria in response to oxidative stress, where it regulates the expression of mitochondrial-encoded\ngenes that control reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, we hypothesize that NKX3.1 regulates oxidative\nstress via its coordinated functions in nuclei and mitochondria, and that these functions are necessary to\nmaintain prostate epithelial differentiation and suppress cancer initiation. Since relatively few nuclear\ntranscriptional regulatory proteins have been shown to function in mitochondria, our studies provide a unique\nopportunity to understand how a tissue-specific transcription factor can control oxidative stress in different sub-\ncellular compartments, and the relevance of these activities for cancer.\n In Aim 1, we will investigate the functions of NKX3.1 in the nucleus for protection from oxidative stress\nand promotion of differentiation. We will investigate: (i) nuclear transcriptional regulatory functions of NKX3.1\nfor protection against oxidative stress; (ii) their relevance for prostate epithelial differentiation and cancer; and\n(iii) whether and if so how these functions impact mitochondrial function. In Aim 2, we will investigate novel\nfunctions of NKX3.1 in mitochondria. Based on our preliminary data showing that, in response to oxidative\nstress, NKX3.1 becomes localized to mitochondria where it regulates the expression of mitochondrial-encoded\ngenes, we will investigate: (i) the mechanisms associated with localization of NKX3.1 to mitochondria; (ii) the\nmechanisms by which NKX3.1 regulates mitochondrial-encoded genes, particularly in comparison with its\nregulation of nuclear genes; and (iii) the importance of these mitochondrial-specific functions of NKX3.1 for\nregulation of oxidative stress and cellular differentiation. In Aim 3, we will complement these mechanistic\nstudies by performing co-clinical studies to evaluate the relevance of regulation of oxidative stress by NKX3.1\nfor suppression of prostate cancer, and whether these activities can be targeted for cancer prevention using\ngenetically-engineered mouse models and a human prostate tissue organotypic model.\n Relevance for PAR-17-203: Our proposed studies provide a unique opportunity to elucidate molecular\nmechanisms that govern the balance between oxidative stress and differentiation and cancer initiation and how\nthese are coordinated between the nucleus and mitochondria.",

            "abstract_text": "The major cause of bladder cancer deaths is due to metastasis, yet to date metastatic bladder cancer\n(mMIBC) has not been extensively studied and many salient issues remain unresolved. One of the major\nchallenges that has hampered progress in studying mMIBC is the lack of suitable models to investigate\nmetastatic progression in vivo. We have now generated novel genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs)\nthat develop highly penetrant mMIBC. These new are based on our established GEMM, in which bladder-specific\nco-inactivation of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressors leads to invasive disease with a low incidence of\nmetastasis. Crossing these Pten; p53 mice with mice harboring loss-of-function of Arid1a, an epigenetic regulator\nthat is dysregulated in a high percentage of human bladder cancers, results in lethal bladder cancer with >80%\nincidence of metastasis. In addition, treatment of the Pten; p53 mice with a low dose of the carcinogen N-butyl-\nN-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) leads to mMIBC with >60% incidence. In parallel, we have implemented\nstate-of-the-art systems biology approaches to identify mechanistic determinants\u2014master regulators (MRs)\u2014of\nmetastatic progression in the GEMMs. MRs enriched in metastatic tumors in the GEMMs are conserved with\nhuman bladder cancer, and are enriched for those associated with lineage plasticity. To identify drugs that target\nthese conserved MRs, we implemented OncoTreat, a computational algorithm that prioritizes drugs based on\ntheir ability to invert the activities of biologically-relevant MR. To validate these drugs, we have generated an\nextensive biobank of human patient derived organoid models. Leveraging these GEMMs, human patient derived\norganoids and systems approaches, we are ideally poised to investigate the hypothesis that the transition from\npre-invasive to metastatic disease is driven by the sequential activities of master regulators, including for lineage\nplasticity, which can be elucidated and targeted by studying metastatic progression in these GEMMs. We will\npursue three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will leverage our GEMMs of mMIBC to systematically investigate the\nbiological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression in vivo. In Aim 2, we will\nelucidate master regulators of metastatic progression, focusing on those associated with the transition from pre-\nmetastatic to metastatic MIBC, and/or that distinguish tumors from their corresponding metastases, metastases\nto different organ sites, and, as feasible, pre-metastatic clusters from overt metastases. We will prioritize MRs\nthat are conserved with human bladder cancer, as well as those associated with lineage plasticity. In Aim 3, we\nwill seek to identify new drugs for mMIBC using the OncoTreat algorithm to identify compounds that invert the\nactivity of MRs of metastasis. We will prioritize candidate drugs that (1) target lineage plasticity mechanisms,\nand/or (2) are inferred for patients that do not have evident actionable driver mutations. Altogether, our studies\nwill provide a comprehensive analysis of the biology, mechanisms, and treatments for mMIBC, with the\ntranslational goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that may improve patient outcomes.",

            "phr_text": "Despite significant improvements in cancer outcomes over the past several decades, metastasis\ncontinues to be the primary cause of cancer-related death, as exemplified for bladder cancer. Indeed, most\npatients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and at least half of those with muscle-invasive bladder cancer\ncan expect to be cured (5-year survival ~90% and ~50%, respectively), whereas most patients with metastatic\nbladder cancer will succumb to the disease within a few years (5-year survival ~15%). My research utilizes novel\nin vivo models to elucidate the biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic bladder\ncancer, with the translational goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that may improve patient outcomes.",

Toward this end, we have developed a series of genetically engineered\nmouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate the phenotypic heterogeneity of metastatic prostate cancer. The\ncenterpiece of this collection of GEMMs is the NPKEYFP mouse model, which develops highly penetrant bone\nmetastasis. This model is complemented by additional GEMMs, namely the NPMEYFP and NPp53EYFP mice, that\ndisplay distinctive metastatic phenotypes. We have performed transcriptomic analyses at the bulk tissue and\nsingle-cell level of prostate tumors and metastases from these GEMMs to identify candidate drivers (master\nregulators (MRs)) of metastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, we have isolated\ncirculating tumor cells (CTCs) from these metastatic GEMMs to study their heterogeneity at the cellular level. In\nparticular, we have established a pipeline to isolate and molecularly characterize individual CTCs as organoids\nand to study the CTCs at the single-cell level. Our investigations have uncovered several themes that shape the\ndirection of our research. In particular, our findings support the concept that specific mutational events (such as\nloss of function of p53 and activation of MYC and RAS signaling) as well as cellular plasticity are key drivers of\nmetastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity.\nThus, we will investigate our hypothesis that heterogeneity of metastasis represents the culmination of\nmolecular, cellular, and organismal differences, as follows: In Aim 1, we will study mechanisms of metastatic\nprogression by: (a) investigating the role of the histone methyltransferase NSD2 by analyses of a new GEMM\nwith gain of function of NSD2 in prostate tumors; and (b) studying cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastatic\nprogression at the single-cell level in primary tumors and lung and bone metastases. In Aim 2, we will investigate\nmolecular mechanisms of phenotypic heterogeneity of metastasis by analyses of our GEMMs that display a\nrange of metastatic phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will examine cellular heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)\nat the single-cell level using organoid models and single-cell sequencing approaches. Taken together, our\nstudies are highly innovative in their combination of sophisticated inducible mouse models, single-cell analyses,\norganoid culture methods, and computational systems approaches to investigate a central problem in cancer\nbiology. Our studies of precision modeling of prostate cancer metastasis may ultimately help guide individualized\npatient care.",

The foundation for our studies is the NPKYPF mouse model, which\ndevelops highly penetrant bone metastasis that is well-conserved with bone metastasis in human prostate\ncancer. Analyses of these mice enable investigations of the evolution of bone metastases during cancer\nprogression in the native microenvironment in androgen-intact and androgen-deprived contexts. We have found\nthat co-activation of MYC and RAS signaling is essential for bone metastasis, and that MYC activation is\nparticularly relevant in contexts of androgen deprivation. Our preliminary studies have identified ATAD2 as a\nMYC-co-factor that is expressed in bone metastasis, particularly in contexts of androgen deprivation, and\nnecessary for bone metastasis. In a complementary genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screening based on human\nprostate cancer xenografts, we identified CITED2, another MYC co-factor, as a cell-intrinsic driver of bone\nmetastasis that it is sufficient to promote bone metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, single cell sequencing of primary\ntumors and bone metastases from NPKYPF mice has led to the identification master regulators (MRs) that are\ncandidate cell intrinsic drivers of bone metastasis, while analyses of the non-tumor components have shown that\nprimary tumors from metastatic NPKYPF mice are deficient for most immune cell populations, but highly enriched\nfor tumor associated macrophages.\n Thus, we will investigate the hypothesis that bone metastasis represents the culmination of cell intrinsic\ndrivers from the metastatic cells and tumor cell extrinsic factors in microenvironment of the metastatic bone. In\nAim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that CITED2 collaborates with MYC to promote bone specificity. In\nparallel, we will investigate candidate master regulators (MRs) associated with RAS pathway activation to\nelucidate their potential roles in bone metastasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that ATAD2 is a\nco-factor for MYC in contexts of androgen deprivation, and elucidate the relationship of androgen status for the\nevolution and underlying mechanisms of bone metastasis. In Aim 3, we will investigate cell extrinsic mechanisms\nin the microenvironment of the primary tumor and metastatic bone, to identify relevant cell populations associated\nwith metastasis, to evaluate their functional role for bone metastasis, and to identify cell extrinsic drivers of bone\nmetastasis.\nIntegration: Our studies are highly complementary to investigations of the tumor microenvironment for\nneuroendocrine differentiation (Project 3) and tumor progression (Project 1). Validation of candidate regulators\nfor human bone metastasis will require Core A. Further, our systematic analysis of bone metastasis at the single\ncell level, complement efforts in Projects 1 and 3, while our ability to mutually benefit from these data will be\nenabled by the data management component of Core B.",

Toward this end, we have developed a series of genetically engineered\nmouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate the phenotypic heterogeneity of metastatic prostate cancer. The\ncenterpiece of this collection of GEMMs is the NPKEYFP mouse model, which develops highly penetrant bone\nmetastasis. This model is complemented by additional GEMMs, namely the NPMEYFP and NPp53EYFP mice, that\ndisplay distinctive metastatic phenotypes. We have performed transcriptomic analyses at the bulk tissue and\nsingle-cell level of prostate tumors and metastases from these GEMMs to identify candidate drivers (master\nregulators (MRs)) of metastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, we have isolated\ncirculating tumor cells (CTCs) from these metastatic GEMMs to study their heterogeneity at the cellular level. In\nparticular, we have established a pipeline to isolate and molecularly characterize individual CTCs as organoids\nand to study the CTCs at the single-cell level. Our investigations have uncovered several themes that shape the\ndirection of our research. In particular, our findings support the concept that specific mutational events (such as\nloss of function of p53 and activation of MYC and RAS signaling) as well as cellular plasticity are key drivers of\nmetastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity.\nThus, we will investigate our hypothesis that heterogeneity of metastasis represents the culmination of\nmolecular, cellular, and organismal differences, as follows: In Aim 1, we will study mechanisms of metastatic\nprogression by: (a) investigating the role of the histone methyltransferase NSD2 by analyses of a new GEMM\nwith gain of function of NSD2 in prostate tumors; and (b) studying cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastatic\nprogression at the single-cell level in primary tumors and lung and bone metastases. In Aim 2, we will investigate\nmolecular mechanisms of phenotypic heterogeneity of metastasis by analyses of our GEMMs that display a\nrange of metastatic phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will examine cellular heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)\nat the single-cell level using organoid models and single-cell sequencing approaches. Taken together, our\nstudies are highly innovative in their combination of sophisticated inducible mouse models, single-cell analyses,\norganoid culture methods, and computational systems approaches to investigate a central problem in cancer\nbiology. Our studies of precision modeling of prostate cancer metastasis may ultimately help guide individualized\npatient care.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n The objective of our research is to elucidate tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that give rise\nto bone metastasis and specify bone tropism. The foundation for our studies is the NPKYPF mouse model, which\ndevelops highly penetrant bone metastasis that is well-conserved with bone metastasis in human prostate\ncancer. Analyses of these mice enable investigations of the evolution of bone metastases during cancer\nprogression in the native microenvironment in androgen-intact and androgen-deprived contexts. We have found\nthat co-activation of MYC and RAS signaling is essential for bone metastasis, and that MYC activation is\nparticularly relevant in contexts of androgen deprivation. Our preliminary studies have identified ATAD2 as a\nMYC-co-factor that is expressed in bone metastasis, particularly in contexts of androgen deprivation, and\nnecessary for bone metastasis. In a complementary genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screening based on human\nprostate cancer xenografts, we identified CITED2, another MYC co-factor, as a cell-intrinsic driver of bone\nmetastasis that it is sufficient to promote bone metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, single cell sequencing of primary\ntumors and bone metastases from NPKYPF mice has led to the identification master regulators (MRs) that are\ncandidate cell intrinsic drivers of bone metastasis, while analyses of the non-tumor components have shown that\nprimary tumors from metastatic NPKYPF mice are deficient for most immune cell populations, but highly enriched\nfor tumor associated macrophages.\n Thus, we will investigate the hypothesis that bone metastasis represents the culmination of cell intrinsic\ndrivers from the metastatic cells and tumor cell extrinsic factors in microenvironment of the metastatic bone. In\nAim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that CITED2 collaborates with MYC to promote bone specificity. In\nparallel, we will investigate candidate master regulators (MRs) associated with RAS pathway activation to\nelucidate their potential roles in bone metastasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that ATAD2 is a\nco-factor for MYC in contexts of androgen deprivation, and elucidate the relationship of androgen status for the\nevolution and underlying mechanisms of bone metastasis. In Aim 3, we will investigate cell extrinsic mechanisms\nin the microenvironment of the primary tumor and metastatic bone, to identify relevant cell populations associated\nwith metastasis, to evaluate their functional role for bone metastasis, and to identify cell extrinsic drivers of bone\nmetastasis.\nIntegration: Our studies are highly complementary to investigations of the tumor microenvironment for\nneuroendocrine differentiation (Project 3) and tumor progression (Project 1). Validation of candidate regulators\nfor human bone metastasis will require Core A. Further, our systematic analysis of bone metastasis at the single\ncell level, complement efforts in Projects 1 and 3, while our ability to mutually benefit from these data will be\nenabled by the data management component of Core B.",

Among the major\nbiological processes that are causally dysregulated in advanced prostate cancer are those related to DNA repair.\nNotably, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are among the most frequently altered DNA repair genes in advanced prostate\ncancer, and are also key targets for its treatment. To study their functions in prostate cancer, we have generated\ngenetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) based on inducible loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in the\nprostate. In preliminary studies, we have found that loss-of-function of Brca2 results in aggressive prostate\ntumors with highly penetrant metastases, including to bone, that are coincident with increased DNA damage and\naccelerated by androgen deprivation. In parallel, we have developed computational tools to elucidate the\nmolecular determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 functions in prostate cancer. We have also developed a new\nprecision oncology platform called OncoLoop, to computationally match individual patients to individual GEMMs,\nand to predict and validate drugs that target specific patient-GEMM pairs.\n Leveraging these models and resources, we will systematically investigate the functions of BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 in prostate cancer, guided by the hypothesis that defective DNA repair plays an important role in\nprostate cancer progression and treatment, particularly in the context of androgen deprivation. In Aim 1, we will\ninvestigate the consequences of loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoid\nmodels, and patient-derived human organoid models for prostate tumorigenesis, metastasis, and DNA damage\nresponse. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate\ncancer and elucidate the relationship of DNA repair mechanisms for disease progression. In Aim 2, we will\ninvestigate molecular determinants of DNA repair functions in prostate cancer by identifying and functionally\ncharacterizing master regulators (MRs) that represent mechanistic determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 loss-of-\nfunction in prostate tumors and metastases. MRs will be prioritized based on conservation with human prostate\ncancer, and functionally validated in mouse and human organoids. We will complement these studies by\nanalyses of tumors and metastases using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify MR signatures\nassociated with specific cell states. In Aim 3, we will leverage our GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoids and\nallografts, and patient-derived organotypic models to pursue co-clinical investigations of DNA repair function in\nprostate cancer. In Aim 3A, we will systematically evaluate drugs/drug combinations currently in or advancing\nto clinical practice. In Aim 3B, we will use the OncoLoop platform to predict new drugs that target DNA repair in\nprostate-specific contexts. Overall, these studies will provide biological and molecular insights to inform on\ncurrent trials and to support the development of future ones.",

            "abstract_text": "The major cause of bladder cancer deaths is due to metastasis, yet to date metastatic bladder cancer\n(mMIBC) has not been extensively studied and many salient issues remain unresolved. One of the major\nchallenges that has hampered progress in studying mMIBC is the lack of suitable models to investigate\nmetastatic progression in vivo. We have now generated novel genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs)\nthat develop highly penetrant mMIBC. These new are based on our established GEMM, in which bladder-specific\nco-inactivation of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressors leads to invasive disease with a low incidence of\nmetastasis. Crossing these Pten; p53 mice with mice harboring loss-of-function of Arid1a, an epigenetic regulator\nthat is dysregulated in a high percentage of human bladder cancers, results in lethal bladder cancer with >80%\nincidence of metastasis. In addition, treatment of the Pten; p53 mice with a low dose of the carcinogen N-butyl-\nN-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) leads to mMIBC with >60% incidence. In parallel, we have implemented\nstate-of-the-art systems biology approaches to identify mechanistic determinants\u2014master regulators (MRs)\u2014of\nmetastatic progression in the GEMMs. MRs enriched in metastatic tumors in the GEMMs are conserved with\nhuman bladder cancer, and are enriched for those associated with lineage plasticity. To identify drugs that target\nthese conserved MRs, we implemented OncoTreat, a computational algorithm that prioritizes drugs based on\ntheir ability to invert the activities of biologically-relevant MR. To validate these drugs, we have generated an\nextensive biobank of human patient derived organoid models. Leveraging these GEMMs, human patient derived\norganoids and systems approaches, we are ideally poised to investigate the hypothesis that the transition from\npre-invasive to metastatic disease is driven by the sequential activities of master regulators, including for lineage\nplasticity, which can be elucidated and targeted by studying metastatic progression in these GEMMs. We will\npursue three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will leverage our GEMMs of mMIBC to systematically investigate the\nbiological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression in vivo. In Aim 2, we will\nelucidate master regulators of metastatic progression, focusing on those associated with the transition from pre-\nmetastatic to metastatic MIBC, and/or that distinguish tumors from their corresponding metastases, metastases\nto different organ sites, and, as feasible, pre-metastatic clusters from overt metastases. We will prioritize MRs\nthat are conserved with human bladder cancer, as well as those associated with lineage plasticity. In Aim 3, we\nwill seek to identify new drugs for mMIBC using the OncoTreat algorithm to identify compounds that invert the\nactivity of MRs of metastasis. We will prioritize candidate drugs that (1) target lineage plasticity mechanisms,\nand/or (2) are inferred for patients that do not have evident actionable driver mutations. Altogether, our studies\nwill provide a comprehensive analysis of the biology, mechanisms, and treatments for mMIBC, with the\ntranslational goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that may improve patient outcomes.",

It is an aggressive tumor\ncharacterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable\nresistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs\ndrive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of\npatient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains\ntranscriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that\ndiffer in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive\nequilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that\nSCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity\nat the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific\ncancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity\nwill: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how\nstochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer\npopulations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately\nneeded new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease. Our team of\ninvestigators have content expertise in several computational, experimental, and translational methods pertinent\nto this proposal including human-derived in vivo and ex vivo model systems, single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk\ngenetic and expression analysis, single cell fluorescence tracking, and mathematical and statistical modeling.\nOur integrative approach is poised to formulate and validate a unified model of cellular states and program\ndiversity in SCLC. If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity\n(SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3)\nwill advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease.",

            "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThere is an urgent need to nominate biomarkers that are likely to predict the efficacy of radiotherapy and\naccelerate their clinical translation. Efforts thus far have been limited in large part because the genetic features\nregulating tumor cell survival and their frequency across and within individual cancer types had not been studied\non a large-scale. Our group completed the largest profiling effort of survival after radiation in cancer cell lines,\ncomprising a diverse collection of 533 genetically annotated tumor cell lines from 26 cancer types. To\ncomplement this work, we recently initiated the systematic profiling of >1000 genetic variants that could\npotentially contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. We combined results from our profiling efforts\nto identify features that predict the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. The objective in this investigation\nis to advance the clinical translation of two of the most important regulators of radiation resistance in lung cancer,\nNrf2 and Braf. The Nrf2 pathway is genetically altered in ~28% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) and cells with mutations in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 are the most highly correlated with resistance to\nradiation. To identify genetic dependencies of Nrf2-active tumors, we used computational and experimental\napproaches to demonstrate the frequent co-occurrence between Nrf2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\nalteration in NSCLCs. Using genetic and chemical means we show that antagonizing the catalytic subunit of\nPI3K, p110 (encoded by PIK3CA), decreases Nrf2 activity and reverses radiation resistance driven by this\npathway. These results provide the rationale to advance a radiosensitization strategy for patients with Nrf2-active\nNSCLC by targeting PI3K. Our profiling efforts also demonstrate a critical role for BRAF, which is genetically\naltered in ~7% of patients with NSCLC, in the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. We show, for the first\ntime, that BRAF kinase domain mutations confer resistance to radiation in lung cancers and that they, unlike\nNrf2 pathway alterations, are almost invariably a minor component of the tumor (i.e. they are subclonal). We use\nmathematical and experimental models to show that clonal architecture has significant implications for the\nlikelihood of response to targeted therapies and radiation. Together, these results provide a compelling rationale\nto examine the role of Nrf2 and Braf alterations in predicting outcomes after radiotherapy and advance a\ngenomically-guided radiosensitization strategy for patients with these tumors. If these hypotheses are correct,\nour results will demonstrate that radiotherapeutic sensitizers can be selected based on both the identity and type\n(clonal v. subclonal) of genetic alterations identified in a patient's cancer, prompting an evolution in the use of\nradiation from a generic approach to one that is guided by the genetic composition of individual tumors.",

Our results indicate the primacy of Nrf2\nand Braf as regulators of radiation resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. The deliverables of this proposal\ninclude new biomarkers calibrated on the basis of radiotherapeutic efficacy and new drug-radiation therapeutic\nstrategies that more precisely and effectively target the most resistant lung tumors to radiation.",

It is an aggressive tumor\ncharacterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable\nresistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs\ndrive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of\npatient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains\ntranscriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that\ndiffer in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive\nequilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that\nSCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity\nat the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific\ncancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity\nwill: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how\nstochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer\npopulations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately\nneeded new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease. Our team of\ninvestigators have content expertise in several computational, experimental, and translational methods pertinent\nto this proposal including human-derived in vivo and ex vivo model systems, single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk\ngenetic and expression analysis, single cell fluorescence tracking, and mathematical and statistical modeling.\nOur integrative approach is poised to formulate and validate a unified model of cellular states and program\ndiversity in SCLC. If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity\n(SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3)\nwill advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease.",

Efforts thus far have been limited in large part because the genetic features\nregulating tumor cell survival and their frequency across and within individual cancer types had not been studied\non a large-scale. Our group completed the largest profiling effort of survival after radiation in cancer cell lines,\ncomprising a diverse collection of 533 genetically annotated tumor cell lines from 26 cancer types. To\ncomplement this work, we recently initiated the systematic profiling of >1000 genetic variants that could\npotentially contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. We combined results from our profiling efforts\nto identify features that predict the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. The objective in this investigation\nis to advance the clinical translation of two of the most important regulators of radiation resistance in lung cancer,\nNrf2 and Braf. The Nrf2 pathway is genetically altered in ~28% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) and cells with mutations in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 are the most highly correlated with resistance to\nradiation. To identify genetic dependencies of Nrf2-active tumors, we used computational and experimental\napproaches to demonstrate the frequent co-occurrence between Nrf2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\nalteration in NSCLCs. Using genetic and chemical means we show that antagonizing the catalytic subunit of\nPI3K, p110 (encoded by PIK3CA), decreases Nrf2 activity and reverses radiation resistance driven by this\npathway. These results provide the rationale to advance a radiosensitization strategy for patients with Nrf2-active\nNSCLC by targeting PI3K. Our profiling efforts also demonstrate a critical role for BRAF, which is genetically\naltered in ~7% of patients with NSCLC, in the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. We show, for the first\ntime, that BRAF kinase domain mutations confer resistance to radiation in lung cancers and that they, unlike\nNrf2 pathway alterations, are almost invariably a minor component of the tumor (i.e. they are subclonal). We use\nmathematical and experimental models to show that clonal architecture has significant implications for the\nlikelihood of response to targeted therapies and radiation. Together, these results provide a compelling rationale\nto examine the role of Nrf2 and Braf alterations in predicting outcomes after radiotherapy and advance a\ngenomically-guided radiosensitization strategy for patients with these tumors. If these hypotheses are correct,\nour results will demonstrate that radiotherapeutic sensitizers can be selected based on both the identity and type\n(clonal v. subclonal) of genetic alterations identified in a patient's cancer, prompting an evolution in the use of\nradiation from a generic approach to one that is guided by the genetic composition of individual tumors.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n There is a large and growing population of amputees whose needs are not being fully met by current\nprosthetic hand technology, which results in reduced quality of life. The long-term goal of the proposed work is\nbased on the notion that prosthetic hand technology that can provide task-related sensations to the residual limb\nof an amputee will increase their proficiency in sensorimotor tasks and therefore allow them to participate in a\ngreater range of employment and leisure activities.\n The Adaptive Neural Systems neural-enabled prosthetic hand (ANS-NEPH) system was designed and\ndeveloped by our lab in collaboration with industrial and clinical partners to provide amputees with task-relevant\nsensations. The system uses signals derived from sensors on an instrumented prosthetic hand to elicit sensations\nby delivering stimulation via fine-wire longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) implanted in peripheral\nnerves of the residual limb. A commercially proven neural stimulation technology from Cochlear Ltd. was re-\nengineered to interface with neural structures in the peripheral nerves with LIFEs.\n In the proposed project, we will continue a longitudinal first-in-human clinical trial to evaluate clinical safety\nand device functionality Four subjects will be enrolled to participate in this long-term study. Each subject will\nhave the implanted components surgically installed, be fitted with the external components of the system,\nparticipate in an extensive series of experiments designed to assess long-term viability of our approach, and use\nit on a daily basis as their primary prosthetic hand.\n The primary outcome of this work will be a demonstration of clinical feasibility of a neural-enabled prosthetic\nhand system for daily use at home (for approximately two years) or at the workplace that uses wirelessly-\ncontrolled implantable stimulation technology. For transradial amputees, real-time sensation is likely to improve\nsensorimotor capabilities; everyday use is likely to enhance embodiment of the prosthesis by the user.\nFurthermore, stimulation of afferent fibers may also reduce the severity and incidence of phantom limb pain.\nThis system will constitute the next generation of prosthetic hand technology for transradial amputees and will\nform the foundation for systems to be developed that can provide sensation to other upper limb amputees\n(transhumeral, shoulder disarticulation). Finally, the deployment and chronic use of an implantable system that\nenables stimulation of discrete sets of small groups of afferent fibers may pave the way for future uses of this\ntechnology to activate peripheral nerves that may influence metabolic processes, enhance immune system\nfunction, regulate gastrointestinal activity, or treat a variety of medical conditions.",

            "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nToday\u2019s motorized upper limb prostheses do not afford amputees with high quality control due to the lack of\ncritical information such as contact force and hand opening, thus causing the user to heavily rely on vision to\ndetermine what the prosthetic hand is doing. This project will conduct a first-in-human demonstration of the\nclinical feasibility of a neural-enabled prosthetic hand system that uses an implanted neural stimulator to\nelectrically activate nerve fibers in the residual limb to provide the user with sensations that are related to the\nactivity of the prosthetic hand. Having a system capable of providing sensory feedback that amputees can use on\nan everyday basis will greatly improve their quality of life and reduce rejection rates of motorized prostheses.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nMammalian cells have evolved multiple non-overlapping mechanisms to ensure that DNA replication initiates\nfrom origins of replications once and only once in each division cycle; loss of control over these mechanisms\ninduces genomic instability, an important driver of malignant transformation. Increasing evidence suggests that\norigin utilization and activation in higher eukaryotes is influenced by epigenetic factors, but exact mechanisms\nare largely undefined. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms that control replication\ninitiation in mammalian cells and to understand how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes genomic\ninstability. The histone methyltransferase SET8 is emerging as a key regulator of replication initiation in\nmammalian cells through its mono-methyltransferase activity on histone H4K20. The cell cycle regulated enzyme\nis essential for origin licensing in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but is proteolytically degraded in S-phase; blocking\nthis step triggers reiterative replication initiation within the same cell cycle or re-replication. Both SET8 and\nH4K20me, however, are also involved in transcriptional repression and in the repair of DNA double strand breaks\n(DSBs), but whether these seemingly independent activities play a role in replication initiation or re-replication is\nnot known. Most importantly, little to nothing is known about the nature or characteristics of the re-replication\nproducts that accumulate in cells with defective SET8 degradation, nor is there information on where in the\ngenome re-replication occurs or if certain genomic regions are more prone to re-replication induction. Our new\nresults show that re-replication resulting from defective SET8 degradation is not a stochastic process, with few\ngenomic sites exhibit large and significant copy number gains, reminiscent of genomic amplifications that are\nseen in cancer cells. Additional preliminary studies suggest that re-replication may originate from DNA double\nstrand breaks (DSBs) that may spontaneously arise during replication, and requires the activity of genes involved\nboth in transcriptional silencing and in DSB repair. Our innovative preliminary studies and experimental\napproaches are designed to thoroughly examine this alternative model of re-replication induction. In Aim 1, we\nwill determine the magnitude (copy number gains) and genomic distribution of the re-replicated DNA in bulk and\nsingle cells with defective SET8 degradation and following the induction of DSBs at defined genomic sites. We\nwill also test if these parameters vary in different cancer cell types and in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. In Aim 2,\nwe will define the roles of histone H4K20 methylation, transcriptional silencing by the H4K20me reader\nL3MBTL1, and proteins involved in the repair of DSBs in effecting re-replication. The successful execution of the\nproposed aims promises to increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating replication initiation in\nmammalian cells, and lead to a better understanding of how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes\ngenomic instability.",

            "phr_text": "Narrative\nInitiation of nuclear DNA replication is tightly regulated such that the entire genome is duplicated exactly once in\nevery cell division cycle. Deregulation of the mechanisms that control this process provokes genomic instability\nand fuels malignant transformation, but is also the underlying cytotoxic activity of a new anti-cancer therapeutic\napproach. In this proposal, we characterize the genomic abnormalities that arise when these mechanisms are\nderailed both in cancer and non-cancer cells and investigate the molecular activities that participate in the\ngeneration of these abnormalities. A full understanding of this process will guide the development of better\nstrategies to treat cancer.",

            "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nMammalian cells have evolved multiple non-overlapping mechanisms to ensure that DNA replication initiates\nfrom origins of replications once and only once in each division cycle; loss of control over these mechanisms\ninduces genomic instability, an important driver of malignant transformation. Increasing evidence suggests that\norigin utilization and activation in higher eukaryotes is influenced by epigenetic factors, but exact mechanisms\nare largely undefined. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms that control replication\ninitiation in mammalian cells and to understand how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes genomic\ninstability. The histone methyltransferase SET8 is emerging as a key regulator of replication initiation in\nmammalian cells through its mono-methyltransferase activity on histone H4K20. The cell cycle regulated enzyme\nis essential for origin licensing in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but is proteolytically degraded in S-phase; blocking\nthis step triggers reiterative replication initiation within the same cell cycle or re-replication. Both SET8 and\nH4K20me, however, are also involved in transcriptional repression and in the repair of DNA double strand breaks\n(DSBs), but whether these seemingly independent activities play a role in replication initiation or re-replication is\nnot known. Most importantly, little to nothing is known about the nature or characteristics of the re-replication\nproducts that accumulate in cells with defective SET8 degradation, nor is there information on where in the\ngenome re-replication occurs or if certain genomic regions are more prone to re-replication induction. Our new\nresults show that re-replication resulting from defective SET8 degradation is not a stochastic process, with few\ngenomic sites exhibit large and significant copy number gains, reminiscent of genomic amplifications that are\nseen in cancer cells. Additional preliminary studies suggest that re-replication may originate from DNA double\nstrand breaks (DSBs) that may spontaneously arise during replication, and requires the activity of genes involved\nboth in transcriptional silencing and in DSB repair. Our innovative preliminary studies and experimental\napproaches are designed to thoroughly examine this alternative model of re-replication induction. In Aim 1, we\nwill determine the magnitude (copy number gains) and genomic distribution of the re-replicated DNA in bulk and\nsingle cells with defective SET8 degradation and following the induction of DSBs at defined genomic sites. We\nwill also test if these parameters vary in different cancer cell types and in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. In Aim 2,\nwe will define the roles of histone H4K20 methylation, transcriptional silencing by the H4K20me reader\nL3MBTL1, and proteins involved in the repair of DSBs in effecting re-replication. The successful execution of the\nproposed aims promises to increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating replication initiation in\nmammalian cells, and lead to a better understanding of how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes\ngenomic instability.",

            "phr_text": "Narrative\nInitiation of nuclear DNA replication is tightly regulated such that the entire genome is duplicated exactly once in\nevery cell division cycle. Deregulation of the mechanisms that control this process provokes genomic instability\nand fuels malignant transformation, but is also the underlying cytotoxic activity of a new anti-cancer therapeutic\napproach. In this proposal, we characterize the genomic abnormalities that arise when these mechanisms are\nderailed both in cancer and non-cancer cells and investigate the molecular activities that participate in the\ngeneration of these abnormalities. A full understanding of this process will guide the development of better\nstrategies to treat cancer.",
