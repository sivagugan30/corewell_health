DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application responds to RFA-NS-02-010 (""Parkinson Disease Neuroprotection Trial: Clinical Centers""). The Southeastern Michigan Parkinson's Disease Program describes the research experience, facilities, and operational capabilities for collaborative sites that will work together closely: the William Beaumont Hospital System, the Clinical Neuroscience Center (CNC), a Parkinson's disease (PD) research and treatment program in Southfield, and the PD clinics at the Wayne State University School of Medicine (WSU SOM) campus in Detroit. We propose to participate in a nationwide effort for recruiting and conducting randomized, double blind clinical trials of neuroprotection for PD. The CNC, designated by the National Parkinson Foundation as Michigan's Center of Excellence, has developed the State's largest PD patient base and referral network. For almost 20 years, the CNC has been one of the nation's leading sites for conducting Phase 1 through IV clinical research in PD. The CNC's extensive affiliations with the region's PD patient community as well as with health providers in Michigan, Ohio, and southwestern Ontario should maximize opportunities for recruiting de novo PD patients. The two sites will enhance the diversity of study participants, especially with the WSU SOM services to a large inner city population and a major Veterans Administration Medical Center.The CNC's extensive experience in PD drug research has involved clinical trials (including several neuroprotection studies) sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, the NIH, and the Parkinson Study Group. The Principal Investigator is enthusiastic to participate in the multi-site collaborative program and can offer a leadership role in the choice and coordination of studies.This application also discusses concepts for three pharmacological agents that could be investigated in pilot studies and, if promising, in multicenter clinical trials for assessing neuroprotection.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large number of imaging studies performed during the course of radiation treatment have indicated substantial patient setup and soft tissue position variation. Consequently, significant temporal variation of dose distribution in organs of interest (TVODD) exists during the course of radiotherapy and presents itself as one of the most difficult problems for quantitative radiotherapy analysis. Without fully understanding this variation, the treatment outcome, particularly normal tissue dose response, cannot be correctly correlated to the prescribed dose, thereby preventing reliable treatment evaluation and optimization. This fundamental problem is further exacerbated for a high conformal treatment. It is our hypothesis that quantifying TVODD in radiotherapy is essential for realizing the potential of advanced treatment technologies (e.g. IMRT). Knowledge of the temporal variation of the dose distribution in critical normal structures can be exploited to improve ongoing treatment, if the variation is quantified. Otherwise, TVODD remains as a major source of uncertainty in the treatment process. To test our hypothesis, the following Specific Aims will be pursued: (1) Integrate a soft tissue biomechanics model and finite element algorithm into the image based organ registration and evaluation system, and perform a study to determine the sensitivity of the registration model to variations of tissue mechanical properties and organ boundary conditions, (2) Validate the image based organ registration, in vivo, by using multiple CT images collected from patients with embedded radiomarkers, (3) Perform clinical studies to determine the potential impact of temporal variation of organ dose distribution on treatment planning evaluation and decisions. Explore practical methods to include temporal variation of organ dose distribution, estimated from image feedback, in treatment planning optimization.  "

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
William Beaumont Hospital (WBH) located in the northwest Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Michigan (1091 beds) and in the rapidly growing suburb of Troy, Michigan (242-beds, approximately twelve miles northeast of Royal Oak), continues to be a highly productive contributor to the NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program. Against the diverse demographic backdrop of Oakland and Macomb Counties (combined population exceeding 2 million) and WBH's history of diagnosing over 4,000 new cancer cases per year, the Beaumont CCOP (BCCOP) is able to offer 110 multi-disciplinary investigators in 20 specialty departments. This includes a strong surgical component as witnessed by the accrual performance achieved during the past two years of our being designated a CCOP. In our first year with the CCOP (2002-03) we were able to accumulate an aggressive 151.3 treatment and 178.6 control credits, for a grand total of 329.9 credits. In our second year as a CCOP (2003-04), with our focus on cancer control, we accumulated an impressive 288.4 control and 99.2 treatment credits, totaling 387.6 strong. Current results indicate that in our third year (2004-05) we anticipate to accrue 190.1 treatment and a noteworthy 374.7 control credits, arriving at an estimated combined total of 563.8 The continuing goals of the BCCOP include increasing the accrual of patients to treatment trials, carefully following patients and participants currently on study, and to further build our cancer control capabilities. The specific aims of the program are to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality by accelerating the transfer of newly developed cancer prevention therapies, to improve early detection rates, and to facilitate patient treatment management, rehabilitation, and the dissemination of scientific results to the profession and to the general public. To ensure that we achieve quality results through the scientific process, we utilize a centralized research support approach through an established Cancer Clinical Trials office (CCTO), an experienced Institutional Review Board (IRB), a credentialed pharmacy staff, a Protocol Review Committee (PRC), and a Steering Committee commissioned to guide and supervise the activities of BCCOP. The Beaumont CCOP bases all activities on our motto: ""Today's clinical trial for tomorrow's standard of care.""

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Control of the primary tumor is a major goal of radiotherapy for cancer. Escalating the dose delivered to the tumor provides a method to improve local control. For lung cancer patients in particular, respiratory-induced organ motion has impeded safe dose escalation. Methods to compensate for this motion or to immobilize the tumor have been developed in recent years. However, these new technologies have not been applied in concert with reduced margins that would enable dose escalation due to the lack of data characterizing uncertainty in respiratory-induced organ motion. It is critical to characterize the uncertainties associated with tumor immobilization to enable the use of appropriate margins. It is our hypothesis that the combination of image guidance techniques and integrated active breath hold radiotherapy will enable characterization and reduction of the geometric uncertainties due to respiratory-induced organ motion. Active breathing control (ABC) has been shown to be a safe and effective means of tumor immobilization for breast cancer patients which allows for the reduction of the dose to normal tissue structures such as the heart and lungs. For lung cancer patients, however, the ABC technique must be adapted to increase compliance for patients with pulmonary compliance issues. Furthermore, the integration of image guidance techniques with ABC radiotherapy enables the characterization and reduction of daily setup variation and immobilization uncertainty. The specific aims of this project are to (1) Measure the random and systematic uncertainties of tumor immobilization for integrated active breath hold radiotherapy. (2) Evaluate a model image-guidance strategy with respect to the presence of these uncertainties and to design a treatment margin to compensate for these uncertainties. (3) Quantify residual setup error in a small population of patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): External beam radiation therapy is a major and effective treatment modality for prostate cancer. Despite the significant improvement over the past decades, tumor control rates and radiation induced complication rates have been suboptimal. One major cause is the geometrical and anatomical variations during the treatment course, such as patient setup and organ motion at each step of treatment process. To account for these uncertainties, margins are added during treatment planning to ensure adequate target coverage. The margins increase the irradiated volume which may encompass a significant portion of critical organs. To reduce margins safely, accurate information of patient anatomy under the treatment condition are required. Recent advancement in delivery system includes mounting a kV X-ray imaging system capable of cone-beam CT on board the linear accelerator. High spatial resolution CT images from the system have good soft tissue contrast to localize prostate gland accurately at treatment condition. However, the benefits of cone-beam CT in reducing uncertainties in clinical environment are unknown and no dosimetric evaluation has been performed in determining the optimal margin reduction using cone-beam CT. The hypothesis of this project is that, optimal and efficient use of the on-board imaging system, integrated with offline adaptive plan optimization and online treatment intervention, can significantly increase the dose gradient between the tumors and critical organs. Three specific aims will be pursued. (1) Develop image guidance strategies for prostate cancer treatment that include online geometric treatment intervention (plan correction) and offline adaptive dosimetric plan re-optimization. The goal of online process is to eliminate uncertainties from setup and inter-fraction motion. The residues and intra-fraction motions are incorporated in the offline process. (2) Evaluate and optimize image guidance strategies through comparative planning studies against the current standard methods and validate cone-beam CT for image guidance. (3) Perform pre-clinical studies to test feasibility and efficiency of the image guidance strategies. The long-term goal of this project is to implement a clinical process of image guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer, in which geometric variations will be incorporated into treatment planning and delivery through image feedback. The adoption of image guidance will allow significantly increased local control and reduced radiation induced complications in prostate cancer patients.

Phase II of the UITN will include continued conduct of the TOMUS trial as well as continuation of the observational follow-up studies for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies (called E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI) conducted in Phase I. Because the primary effort of Phase II will be directed toward conduct of the TOMUS trial, this proposal describes in detail the scientific rationale for and the conduct of this trial. The protocol for this trial was developed in response to a request from NIDDK in mid-2004 for development of a third study to be conducted by the UITN. The protocol was subsequently reviewed in May 2005 by an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee constituted by the NIDDK and then by the UITN DSMB in the fall of 2005. At each point of review, recommendations by the respective committees were considered carefully by the UITN investigators and revisions to the protocol were made where considered indicated and appropriate. The UITN DSMB approved the protocol in February 2006 and recruitment for the trial will start in late March 2006. This proposal also describes the Study Aims and methods for the E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI studies (section D.7).

Extensive review of the literature shows that the success rate (continence) and improvement rate appear to be similar among all of the three surgical techniques proposed in this CTC. Although the complications may be more unique with one or the other, it also appears that the morbidity rate is similar. Therefore, we do not believe that a power calculation can be performed to estimate the total number of subjects needed to be enrolled in each group. Therefore, we believe that the total number of subjects may have to be arbitrarily decided by the network to assure an adequate number of patients to be observed to gather all the necessary information to satisfy the objectives of this study. The principal goal of incontinence therapy is to improve the quality of life for the patient. Patient satisfaction in long-term follow-up has not been adequately reported in the literature. This study can provide the extensive review of these issues. However, the criteria on which the comparisons are made will necessarily be agreed upon by the collective investigators. In addition, the economics of the proposed procedures will also have a bearing on the overall medicoeconomic outcomes.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
The Grand Rapids Clinical Oncology Program (GRCOP) has achieved a national reputation for excellence in community cancer care through its 29-year participation in programs of the National Cancer Institute. In 2003, the GRCOP was highlighted by the NCI as one of 27 CCOPs continuously funded since 1983. The GRCOP comprises a consortium of nine health care systems/hospitals in Western and lower-Northern Michigan and seeks to continue to meet the community's need for innovative and relevant studies of promising therapeutic modalities and cancer controls research. The ongoing mission of the Grand Rapids Clinical Oncology Program is to assure that every person in the region served is provided an opportunity for participation in national cancer prevention and treatment clinical trials. Additionally, we strive to provide education about cancer and the NCI clinical trials program. This grant application encompasses and articulates an ever-expanding vision for the GRCOP. Key strategies to increase patient access and accrual to research protocols include: (1) expansion of on-site screening and patient identification for enrollment in research protocols; (2) development of a targeted clinical trials program for adolescents/young adults; (3) the addition of the Radiation Oncology Therapy Group (RTOG) as a research base, bringing the number of NCI research bases with which the GRCOP affiliates to 8; (4) partnering with NCI in its efforts to increase accrual of the elderly population to clinical trials; and (5) increased involvement by primary care providers and specialty physicians in cancer prevention and control protocols. Strategic initiatives to increase access to and participation in cancer clinical trials by underserved and minority populations incorporate alignment with community organizations throughout the patient catchment area, with an expanding focus on the growing Hispanic/Latino population. Of importance during this upcoming grant cycle will be the GRCOP's continued focus on improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of participation in clinical trials through expansion of its data management software system to include both a drug inventory management module and an IRB module. The GRCOP is confident these goals will be accomplished because of the investigators and staff firmly believes that what they do is critically important for present and future oncologic care. The Grand Rapids Clinical Oncology Program represents a proven resource with significant ongoing potential to serve the objectives of the National Cancer Institute's CCOP program. Convinced that our patients are better served by the availability of a strong, quality-oriented community research program, the Grand Rapids Clinical Oncology Program is committed to remaining one of the most successful CCOPs in the country, contributing significantly to oncology clinical research.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): External beam radiation therapy is a major and effective treatment modality for prostate cancer. Despite the significant improvement over the past decades, tumor control rates and radiation induced complication rates have been suboptimal. One major cause is the geometrical and anatomical variations during the treatment course, such as patient setup and organ motion at each step of treatment process. To account for these uncertainties, margins are added during treatment planning to ensure adequate target coverage. The margins increase the irradiated volume which may encompass a significant portion of critical organs. To reduce margins safely, accurate information of patient anatomy under the treatment condition are required. Recent advancement in delivery system includes mounting a kV X-ray imaging system capable of cone-beam CT on board the linear accelerator. High spatial resolution CT images from the system have good soft tissue contrast to localize prostate gland accurately at treatment condition. However, the benefits of cone-beam CT in reducing uncertainties in clinical environment are unknown and no dosimetric evaluation has been performed in determining the optimal margin reduction using cone-beam CT. The hypothesis of this project is that, optimal and efficient use of the on-board imaging system, integrated with offline adaptive plan optimization and online treatment intervention, can significantly increase the dose gradient between the tumors and critical organs. Three specific aims will be pursued. (1) Develop image guidance strategies for prostate cancer treatment that include online geometric treatment intervention (plan correction) and offline adaptive dosimetric plan re-optimization. The goal of online process is to eliminate uncertainties from setup and inter-fraction motion. The residues and intra-fraction motions are incorporated in the offline process. (2) Evaluate and optimize image guidance strategies through comparative planning studies against the current standard methods and validate cone-beam CT for image guidance. (3) Perform pre-clinical studies to test feasibility and efficiency of the image guidance strategies. The long-term goal of this project is to implement a clinical process of image guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer, in which geometric variations will be incorporated into treatment planning and delivery through image feedback. The adoption of image guidance will allow significantly increased local control and reduced radiation induced complications in prostate cancer patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): OVERVIEW OF PROPOSAL This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-DK-06-501 for continuation of the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN). Phase II of the UITN will include continued conduct of the TOMUS trial as well as continuation of the observational follow-up studies for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies (called E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI) conducted in Phase I. Because the primary effort of Phase II will be directed toward conduct of the TOMUS trial, this proposal describes in detail the scientific rationale for and the conduct of this trial. The protocol for this trial was developed in response to a request from NIDDK in mid-2004 for development of a third study to be conducted by the UITN. The protocol was subsequently reviewed in May 2005 by an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee constituted by the NIDDK and then by the UITN DSMB in the fall of 2005. At each point of review, recommendations by the respective committees were considered carefully by the UITN investigators and revisions to the protocol were made where considered indicated and appropriate. The UITN DSMB approved the protocol in February 2006 and recruitment for the trial will start in late March 2006. This proposal also describes the Study Aims and methods for the E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI studies (section D.7). The full protocols, including a description of the Study Aims, designs and methods for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies are included in Appendix B.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an important online imaging modality for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) as well as other forms of image guided interventions. However, current CBCT image quality is inferior to that of the diagnostic fan beam CT. The image quality problem is inherent in the design of the current CBCT system, which is composed of a point x-ray source and a two-dimensional flat panel imager (FPI). Excessive x-ray scatters, the use of low performance FPI, and reconstruction degradation at large cone angles are three major sources of the degradation of image quality. The inferior image quality of CBCT limits the use of this modality for important new IGRT treatment techniques. We have designed a novel quasi-CBCT scanning system comprising a linear scan x-ray source and a linear discrete x-ray detector array. This imaging system will overcome the defects inherent in FPI-based CBCT and thereby produce online images with diagnostic quality. The linear x-ray tube and detector array are aligned perpendicular to and within the rotation plane, respectively. The x-ray beams are narrowly collimated into fan beams and scan in the z-direction electronically. This system will produce diagnostic quality online images for IGRT due to its scatter rejection mechanism and high-performance discrete x-ray detectors. Besides improved image quality, this system also has larger clearance due to its slim structure. Diagnostic online images will facilitate new IGRT techniques with better tumor killing and normal tissue sparing. This innovative design will also have huge impact on other forms of image guided intervention as well as diagnostic imaging. A quasi-CBCT bench-top system will be built in this research. The feasibility and improvement of image quality of the quasi-CBCT system will be studied. Techniques and parameters for clinical implementation will be obtained.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary incontinence (UI) affects more than one in three adult women in the United States, costs as much as $16 to $32 billion yearly, and contributes significantly to dependency, social isolation, and depression in older women. Individualized teaching of behavior modification program (BMP) is known as one of the standard treatments for UI but is costly and time consuming for patients and providers. Group-Session Teaching of a Behavioral Modification Program (GST-BMP) has significant potential to deliver effective UI prevention and treatment to larger groups of women from all geographic and socioeconomic strata. Our preliminary studies of GST-BMP have demonstrated that not only is the ability to teach effectively transferable to other instructors but GST-BMP is also effective in treating incontinence in adult ambulatory women =55 years old. Treatment group paired analysis in our pilot study showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in voiding frequency, leak diameter in cough test, and vaginal digital pressure, displacement, and duration scores. Overall, UI symptom severity was statistically significantly reduced among the treatment group (52.2%) compared to the control group (16.7%), p=0.025. Given the magnitude of the problem of UI, there is a need to expand this preliminary work to evaluate long-term clinical and economic outcomes of GST-BMP, and to test whether outcomes achieved in our pilot study can be replicated by other providers at centers throughout the US. If so, this could lead to widespread implementation of community-based programs that may be more convenient and cost-effective for vulnerable populations with limited access to health care services. Therefore, we are seeking planning grant support to develop a Phase III multi-center randomized control trial testing the clinical and economic outcomes of GST-BMP compared to individualized BMP. Under this planning grant we will assemble a multidisciplinary team of experts in urology, urogynecology, urology nursing, geriatric urology, geriatric medicine, behavioral science, health economics, and outcomes research. The major goal of this team is to prepare a Phase III randomized clinical trial ready for multi-site implementation upon conclusion of this planning grant. We will develop a detailed Manual of Procedures (MOP) and prepare and submit to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) an investigator-initiated research proposal using an R01 mechanism and a clinical trial methodology to test two hypotheses: 1) GST-BMP is clinically as effective in the treatment of stress, urge, and mixed UI as individualized BMP; and 2) GST-BMP is cost-effective compared to individualized BMP in treating stress, urge, and mixed UI.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): OVERVIEW OF PROPOSAL This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-DK-06-501 for continuation of the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN). Phase II of the UITN will include continued conduct of the TOMUS trial as well as continuation of the observational follow-up studies for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies (called E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI) conducted in Phase I. Because the primary effort of Phase II will be directed toward conduct of the TOMUS trial, this proposal describes in detail the scientific rationale for and the conduct of this trial. The protocol for this trial was developed in response to a request from NIDDK in mid-2004 for development of a third study to be conducted by the UITN. The protocol was subsequently reviewed in May 2005 by an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee constituted by the NIDDK and then by the UITN DSMB in the fall of 2005. At each point of review, recommendations by the respective committees were considered carefully by the UITN investigators and revisions to the protocol were made where considered indicated and appropriate. The UITN DSMB approved the protocol in February 2006 and recruitment for the trial will start in late March 2006. This proposal also describes the Study Aims and methods for the E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI studies (section D.7). The full protocols, including a description of the Study Aims, designs and methods for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies are included in Appendix B.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida, a congenital defect of the spinal cord, causes nerve damage and a loss of sensation and muscle function below the waist resulting in bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction. Patients cannot urinate or are constantly wet, and this continues throughout life causing major quality of life and health problems. Clean intermittent catheterization is usually needed to empty the bladder properly. Antimuscarinic medications are commonly required to alleviate high urinary tract pressures that can cause irreversible kidney damage, where dialysis or kidney transplant is the only way to sustain life. Dr. Xiao developed and is performing a novel procedure in China that connects a functioning, healthy lumbar spinal nerve root to the sacral nerve that controls the bladder. The end result is the creation of a new reflex where the bladder can be emptied by scratching or stimulating the skin supplied by that spinal nerve root. He has reported that in 92 SCI patients, 88% regained bladder control within one year after the nerve rerouting surgery and in 110 children with spina bifida, reported success in 87% at one year. However, in China rigorous follow up is challenging, therefore much is still unknown about the neurorecovery post surgery, complications and results occurring in the first year in particular, and the potential role that central nervous system remodeling may play in achieving successful outcomes. At Beaumont, a pilot study is underway on 9 spina bifida subjects, however no other center in the US is currently studying this technique. Our preliminary data are very promising, and with 9 subjects now 12 months post procedure, 7/9 subjects are voiding either voluntarily or by stimulating the new reflex mechanism. This project aims to expand upon our pilot experience to conduct a larger and more rigorous study to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed somatic-autonomic reflex pathway procedure in gaining bladder and bowel control in patients with spina bifida. Additionally, we will systemically evaluate and optimize frequency and location for excitation of the new somatic-autonomic reflex arc to a) gain more insight into the neurorecovery associated with nerve rerouting, and b) scientifically and systematically determine the ideal stimulation parameters to achieve best voiding results and make the somatic-autonomic reflex pathway rerouting most useful for the patients. Achieving the aims outlined in this proposal will help firmly establish the procedure as safe and effective, and revolutionize the treatment of bladder and bowel dysfunction in patients with spina bifida. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spina Bifida, a congenital defect of the spinal cord, causes nerve damage resulting in bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction. Dr. Xiao, in China, developed a new procedure to rewire the nerves affecting the bladder, and this project aims to scientifically establish the safety and effectiveness of the surgical procedure.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 2002, we have been successful in developing intravesical liposomes for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC). We have discovered and translated intravesical instillation of liposome formulation that can coat and protect the bladder. The results from biodistribution studies confirmed our hypothesis that liposomes delivered to the urinary bladder lumen reside in the bladder for an extended period and have low systemic bioavailability. There is a tremendous unmet medical need for a better and safer way to deliver BoNT to the urinary bladder. Our novel technology of liposome based delivery of BoNT is logical and promising. The successful funding and completion of this grant can lead to submission of a clinical IND trial for liposome-BoNT and fulfill the mission of NIH translational research priority. The research team and facility at the Urology department at Beaumont has been significantly strengthened. Dr. Pradeep Tyagi, a previous consultant at the University of Pittsburgh, has since been recruited to join Dr. Chancellor at Beaumont in the fall of 2008. Drs. Tyagi and Chancellor has worked together for eight years and with Dr. Tyagi's strong expertise in liposome pharmacology, the facility and resources are now full ready to successfully complete the projects of this grant. In this grant we will evaluate liquid liposome delivery of liposome- BoNT into the bladder without the need for cystoscopic-guided needle injection for PBS/IC, and study the mechanism of action of intravesical liposomal drug delivery.  The goals of the project described in the proposal are to: 1) formulate BoNT into liposomes; 2) assess endocytosis as a mechanism for the bladder uptake of BoNT from instilled liposomal BoNT in the absence or presence of bladder distension; and 3) determine the lowest effective dose of BoNT in synergy with bladder distension. We have three aims: Aim 1: Formulate BoNT-A into liposomes and determine in vitro stability and sustained release. Aim 2a: To study endocytosis as a mechanism of bladder uptake of liposomal-BoNT after instillation. Aim 2b: Assess liposomal-BoNT local toxicity. Aim 3: To study the biological efficacy of liposomal-BoNT in rat. Successful completion of the project goals will improve the safety of BoNT and promote wide acceptance in the urology community.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of a safe and effective new treatment for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) is an unmet need for many Americans and a research priority at the NIH. The knowledge gained as a result of conducting the experiments under this grant will confirm our hypotheses regarding the potential for liquid instillation of botulinum toxin and move toward bring a new treatment for PBS/IC.

DESCRIPTION: Because of current, limited options for treating overactive bladder (OAB) or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), there is a great demand for the development of new treatment strategy. In this application, the following key aims utilize unique and innovative expertise, available at William Beaumont Hospital and University of Pittsburgh to develop new therapeutic options for OAB and detrusor overactivity (DO) by especially targeting bladder afferent hyperexcitability, which has been proposed as one of the important mechanisms underlying OAB, using rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). Sequence-specific gene-silencing mechanism is a promising approach for developing therapeutics agent based on rational gene-based drug design. In the current proposal, we propose to use this approach for silencing nerve growth factor (NGF) gene locally in the bladder. Local inhibition of NGF gene in bladder akin to antisense eye drops for corneal angiogenesis can avoid the safety concerns noted with systemic anti-NGF therapy from monoclonal human NGF antibodies (tanezumab) such as paresthesia, hypoesthesia and arthralgia. By comparing the pharmacology of NGF antisense administered via different routes, we propose to investigate the contribution of NGF derived from urothelium on afferent hyperexcitability leading to DO in SCI animals. Secondly, we will also test the hypothesis of OAB pathology triggered by changes in voltage- gated sodium and potassium channels, increased cytokines expression/release as well as muscarinic receptors, and such changes are mediated by excessive NGF expression in bladder. The proposed experiments will use antisense to elucidate whether NGF inhibition could normalize changes in muscarinic and ion channel mechanisms contributing to afferent hyperexcitability resulting in DO/OAB. We will study the changes in the local muscarinic cholinergic mechanism underlying DO, including altered sensitivity to various antimuscarinic agents. This mechanism is important to investigate because there is increasing evidence that non-neural acetylcholine (ACh) released from the urothelium during stretch can activate muscarinic receptors, leading to modulation of afferent pathways during the micturition reflex, and that increased ACh levels in the bladder can induce OAB mediated by the local effects on muscarinic receptors in the urothelium/suburothelium. The long-term objectives of the research program are to establish new and effective therapeutic targets and/or interventions strategies for the treatment of OAB.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overactive bladder (OAB) inducing urgency and urinary frequency increasingly interfere with the quality of life, and are sometimes difficult to treat. This project seeks to clarify the neurogenic mechanisms inducing bladder overactivity using the animal model of OAB in order to provide a translational foundation for the development of new therapeutic modalities such as nerve growth factor (NGF) antisense treatment for this difficult condition.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida, a congenital defect of the spinal cord, causes nerve damage and a loss of sensation and muscle function below the waist resulting in bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction. Patients cannot urinate or are constantly wet, and this continues throughout life causing major quality of life and health problems. Clean intermittent catheterization is usually needed to empty the bladder properly. Antimuscarinic medications are commonly required to alleviate high urinary tract pressures that can cause irreversible kidney damage, where dialysis or kidney transplant is the only way to sustain life. Dr. Xiao developed and is performing a novel procedure in China that connects a functioning, healthy lumbar spinal nerve root to the sacral nerve that controls the bladder. The end result is the creation of a new reflex where the bladder can be emptied by scratching or stimulating the skin supplied by that spinal nerve root. He has reported that in 92 SCI patients, 88% regained bladder control within one year after the nerve rerouting surgery and in 110 children with spina bifida, reported success in 87% at one year. However, in China rigorous follow up is challenging, therefore much is still unknown about the neurorecovery post surgery, complications and results occurring in the first year in particular, and the potential role that central nervous system remodeling may play in achieving successful outcomes. At Beaumont, a pilot study is underway on 9 spina bifida subjects, however no other center in the US is currently studying this technique. Our preliminary data are very promising, and with 9 subjects now 12 months post procedure, 7/9 subjects are voiding either voluntarily or by stimulating the new reflex mechanism. This project aims to expand upon our pilot experience to conduct a larger and more rigorous study to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed somatic-autonomic reflex pathway procedure in gaining bladder and bowel control in patients with spina bifida. Additionally, we will systemically evaluate and optimize frequency and location for excitation of the new somatic-autonomic reflex arc to a) gain more insight into the neurorecovery associated with nerve rerouting, and b) scientifically and systematically determine the ideal stimulation parameters to achieve best voiding results and make the somatic-autonomic reflex pathway rerouting most useful for the patients. Achieving the aims outlined in this proposal will help firmly establish the procedure as safe and effective, and revolutionize the treatment of bladder and bowel dysfunction in patients with spina bifida. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spina Bifida, a congenital defect of the spinal cord, causes nerve damage resulting in bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction. Dr. Xiao, in China, developed a new procedure to rewire the nerves affecting the bladder, and this project aims to scientifically establish the safety and effectiveness of the surgical procedure.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many studies collect a wealth of information that, although not integral to achieving their primary purpose, proves to be extremely valuable in answering subsequent research questions. Even though extracting and analyzing existing data may be efficient and cost effective, identifying meaningful relationships within the volumes of data often contained in existing datasets can be challenging. Developing reliable and effective statistical models to aid in mining data enhances the ability to utilize the data to answer novel research questions with significant potential to impact troubling conditions such as urinary incontinence (UI). Beaumont, Royal Oak investigator and urologist, Dr. Ananias Diokno, has accumulated a wealth of data over the past two decades from in depth population-based studies of UI. Dr. Diokno's significant productivity in UI research contributed to earning a coveted NIH MERIT award. These data are now contained in two databases. The first contains information gathered during the original Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social Aspects of Aging (MESA) project. Funded by the National Institutes on Aging (NIA), this multi-stage longitudinal study of senior men and women began in 1983 and focused on factors related to the epidemiology of UI (MESA 1 database). The second database (MESA 2 database) contains data collected during a subsequent collaborative study with Dr. Carolyn Sampselle at the University of Michigan. The aim of this multiphase prospective, randomized controlled ""MESA 2"" trial was to prevent UI in older women. Continent women 55 years and older were recruited from mailings and clinic visits and were randomized to a behavior modification program (BMP) treatment or control group. Many of the interview questions and other data collected during this prevention trial were the same, or similar, to those collected in the original MESA 1 database study. In this proposed project, Dr. Diokno and his team at Beaumont, Royal Oak, MI will build upon established collaborations with internationally recognized data mining experts Dr. Mohammad Siadat and colleagues at Oakland University in nearby Rochester, Michigan, and Dr. Sampselle at the University of Michigan. Dr. Diokno's domain knowledge and possession of the MESA data provides a unique opportunity to create a robust ""Urinary Continence Index"" to identify women who are likely to become incontinent over time. Since UI is more prevalent in women than men and the underlying causes differ, this project will focus on developing a UI index for use in women. However, the statistical modeling methods developed might be applied in future projects using male MESA subjects' data or other data to identify predictive indices for UI or perhaps other chronic and costly conditions. We propose a novel application of data mining strategies to identify salient predictors of UI in women and create and test a predictive index. We are in an extraordinary position to further utilize MESA data and take a major step towards developing a predictive index for widespread use. Since UI is a costly condition contributing to social isolation and poor quality of life, establishing a clinically useful index would create significant opportunities for focused prevention and early intervention strategies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 2002, we have been successful in developing intravesical liposomes for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC). We have discovered and translated intravesical instillation of liposome formulation that can coat and protect the bladder. The results from biodistribution studies confirmed our hypothesis that liposomes delivered to the urinary bladder lumen reside in the bladder for an extended period and have low systemic bioavailability. There is a tremendous unmet medical need for a better and safer way to deliver BoNT to the urinary bladder. Our novel technology of liposome based delivery of BoNT is logical and promising. The successful funding and completion of this grant can lead to submission of a clinical IND trial for liposome-BoNT and fulfill the mission of NIH translational research priority. The research team and facility at the Urology department at Beaumont has been significantly strengthened. Dr. Pradeep Tyagi, a previous consultant at the University of Pittsburgh, has since been recruited to join Dr. Chancellor at Beaumont in the fall of 2008. Drs. Tyagi and Chancellor has worked together for eight years and with Dr. Tyagi's strong expertise in liposome pharmacology, the facility and resources are now full ready to successfully complete the projects of this grant. In this grant we will evaluate liquid liposome delivery of liposome- BoNT into the bladder without the need for cystoscopic-guided needle injection for PBS/IC, and study the mechanism of action of intravesical liposomal drug delivery.  The goals of the project described in the proposal are to: 1) formulate BoNT into liposomes; 2) assess endocytosis as a mechanism for the bladder uptake of BoNT from instilled liposomal BoNT in the absence or presence of bladder distension; and 3) determine the lowest effective dose of BoNT in synergy with bladder distension. We have three aims: Aim 1: Formulate BoNT-A into liposomes and determine in vitro stability and sustained release. Aim 2a: To study endocytosis as a mechanism of bladder uptake of liposomal-BoNT after instillation. Aim 2b: Assess liposomal-BoNT local toxicity. Aim 3: To study the biological efficacy of liposomal-BoNT in rat. Successful completion of the project goals will improve the safety of BoNT and promote wide acceptance in the urology community.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of a safe and effective new treatment for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) is an unmet need for many Americans and a research priority at the NIH. The knowledge gained as a result of conducting the experiments under this grant will confirm our hypotheses regarding the potential for liquid instillation of botulinum toxin and move toward bring a new treatment for PBS/IC.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many studies collect a wealth of information that, although not integral to achieving their primary purpose, proves to be extremely valuable in answering subsequent research questions. Even though extracting and analyzing existing data may be efficient and cost effective, identifying meaningful relationships within the volumes of data often contained in existing datasets can be challenging. Developing reliable and effective statistical models to aid in mining data enhances the ability to utilize the data to answer novel research questions with significant potential to impact troubling conditions such as urinary incontinence (UI). Beaumont, Royal Oak investigator and urologist, Dr. Ananias Diokno, has accumulated a wealth of data over the past two decades from in depth population-based studies of UI. Dr. Diokno's significant productivity in UI research contributed to earning a coveted NIH MERIT award. These data are now contained in two databases. The first contains information gathered during the original Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social Aspects of Aging (MESA) project. Funded by the National Institutes on Aging (NIA), this multi-stage longitudinal study of senior men and women began in 1983 and focused on factors related to the epidemiology of UI (MESA 1 database). The second database (MESA 2 database) contains data collected during a subsequent collaborative study with Dr. Carolyn Sampselle at the University of Michigan. The aim of this multiphase prospective, randomized controlled ""MESA 2"" trial was to prevent UI in older women. Continent women 55 years and older were recruited from mailings and clinic visits and were randomized to a behavior modification program (BMP) treatment or control group. Many of the interview questions and other data collected during this prevention trial were the same, or similar, to those collected in the original MESA 1 database study. In this proposed project, Dr. Diokno and his team at Beaumont, Royal Oak, MI will build upon established collaborations with internationally recognized data mining experts Dr. Mohammad Siadat and colleagues at Oakland University in nearby Rochester, Michigan, and Dr. Sampselle at the University of Michigan. Dr. Diokno's domain knowledge and possession of the MESA data provides a unique opportunity to create a robust ""Urinary Continence Index"" to identify women who are likely to become incontinent over time. Since UI is more prevalent in women than men and the underlying causes differ, this project will focus on developing a UI index for use in women. However, the statistical modeling methods developed might be applied in future projects using male MESA subjects' data or other data to identify predictive indices for UI or perhaps other chronic and costly conditions. We propose a novel application of data mining strategies to identify salient predictors of UI in women and create and test a predictive index. We are in an extraordinary position to further utilize MESA data and take a major step towards developing a predictive index for widespread use. Since UI is a costly condition contributing to social isolation and poor quality of life, establishing a clinically useful index would create significant opportunities for focused prevention and early intervention strategies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary Incontinence (UI) is a prevalent condition that diminishes quality of life in older women at tremendous social and economic costs. Although there are several therapeutic options available, behavioral treatments are recommended by most evidence-based guidelines as an initial approach to treatment for stress, urgency, and mixed UI. Behavioral treatments are usually delivered in individualized visits in medical offices, but a group session model of care delivery has been shown to be effective. Based on promising outcomes in our pilot studies using a novel group treatment approach, we were awarded a planning grant to assemble an interdisciplinary team of experts and develop a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed study is a three-site RCT to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group-administered behavioral treatment program to no treatment. Women with stress, urgency, or mixed UI will be recruited and screened centrally, evaluated clinically at each of three study sites, and randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:  1) Group behavioral treatment (GBT) or  2) No treatment. Outcomes will be assessed at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-randomization. The primary outcome will be self- reported UI severity as measured by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-UI Short Form (ICI-Q), a validated measure for research and practice. Secondary outcome measures will assess frequency of incontinence episodes, volume of urine loss, type of incontinence, pelvic floor muscle strength, patient satisfaction, patient perception of improvement, impact on quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Once standardized with data to support its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, group treatment modalities have potential to reach a larger population of older women with UI, not only in traditional medical settings, but also in community settings, significantly reducing the human and economic burden of UI on patients, health care providers, and the health care system as a whole.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most malignant brain tumors. Patients rarely survive more than a year after the initial diagnosis, primarily due to the highly infiltrative/invasive behavior of these tumors, and their resistance to chemotherapy. The proposed studies arise from our efforts to understand the invasive properties of gliomas as an approach to identify unique therapeutic targets. One of the targets we have identified is Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), which is a matricellular protein that is secreted into the extracellular matrix. We have demonstrated that SPARC is highly expressed in gliomas, and that it promotes glioma invasion in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that SPARC induces migration and invasion via the activation of p38 MAPK-MAPKAPK2-HSP27 signaling pathway. HSP27 is a member of the small heat shock proteins that function to modulate the actin cytoskeleton and migration. We have demonstrated that inhibition of HSP27 suppresses SPARC-induced changes in cell morphology, migration and invasion in vitro in PTEN- null glioma cells. We have also demonstrated that the re-expression of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene commonly lost or mutated in glioblastomas, suppresses SPARC-induced migration in vitro and invasion in vivo. We therefore propose that PTEN loss enables SPARC-induced migration and invasion via phosphorylation of HSP27. To test this hypothesis we propose the following aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Characterize SPARC- induced activation of HSP27 in the absence or presence of PTEN in cell lines and human tissues. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine whether inhibition of HSP27 alone, or in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy, reduces tumor survival in vitro using tumor cells with different SPARC and PTEN status. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine whether inhibition of HSP27 alone, or in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy, reduces SPARC-induced tumor cell invasion and survival in vivo and increases animal survival, using tumor cells with different PTEN status. We propose that pHSP27 inhibition in the commonly occurring SPARC-positive, PTEN-deleted GBMs can have a significant impact on inhibiting glioma cell invasion and is an important clinical strategy for glioma patients.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: SPARC promotes glioblastoma invasion in vitro and in vivo by activating a signaling pathway that increases phosphorylation of HSP27, and PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that suppresses SPARC-induced migration in vitro and in vivo. We propose that the loss of PTEN, commonly observed in glioblastomas, promotes HSP27 phosphorylation by SPARC, commonly upregulated in glioblastomas. We propose that these studies will demonstrate that pHSP27 inhibition in the commonly occurring SPARC-positive, PTEN-deleted GBMs can have a significant impact on inhibiting glioma cell invasion and is an important clinical strategy for glioma patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obstruction of the upper urinary tract is a major clinical problem that results in progressive, and ultimately, irreversible renal insufficiency. The majority of obstructive renal injury is attributed to progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal tubular epithelial cell damage. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a recently discovered pro-inflammatory cytokine that is structurally and functionally related to the IL-1 family. In humans, urinary IL-18 levels have been shown to be a sensitive and early marker of renal tubular damage from ischemic and post-transplantation ATN17, 84. Recently, circulating IL-18 levels and renal IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) expression has been shown to be elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease18, 85, 86. We therefore sought to examine IL-18's role in obstruction-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-18 stimulates obstruction-induced renal fibrosis, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and apoptotic cell death without altering downstream TNF-1 or TGF-21 activity. IL-18 was further observed to stimulate an increase in toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression during renal obstruction in vivo and upon direct stimulation of tubular epithelial cells in vitro, and direct antagonism of TLR4 in vitro reduced markers of IL-18-induced tubular cell injury, while direct stimulation of TLR4 increased markers of IL-18-induced tubular cell injury. We therefore hypothesize that IL-18 is a critical mediator of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell damage during obstruction, and further, that IL-18's injurious effect is mediated through increased TLR4 expression. We will investigate this hypothesis by inducing unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in genetically altered mice or by direct stimulation of tubular epithelial cells in vitro, and examine IL-18's role in obstruction-induced fibrosis, EMT, and apoptosis. We will then evaluate IL-18-induced TLR4 expression and activity as a mechanism of renal fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell damage, and finally, will evaluate STAT3's role in downstream IL-18 and TLR-4 signal transduction during UUO and its contribution to obstruction-induced fibrosis, EMT, and apoptosis. These studies will help elucidate the important role of IL-18 in obstructive renal injury and may provide a clinically relevant therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obstructive renal injury.

Urinary incontinence and other lower urinary tract symptoms exert a major influence on the health and independence of older people (Taylor and Kuchel 2006). Although urinary incontinence is often thought of as the inability to hold in urine because of a weak or damaged sphincter, it also includes issues of urinary retention or the inability to completely empty the bladder, leading to retention and overflow. This is also known as underactive bladder or UAB. Currently, no medications or therapies have proven effective in the long-term treatment of UAB and no known cure exists. As a result, patients who suffer from UAB are managed with in-dwelling catheters, clean intermittent catheterization, or must wear diapers. Use of these devices creates immense difficulties and challenges for elderly individually and their caretakers. UAB patients using catheters to ensure the emptying of their bladders also face long-term medical difficulties, including inflammation and discomfort, the potential for injury, and an increased risk of bacterial infection. Urinary tract infections can lead to kidney damage and blood infections. In addition, for many individuals, the use of catheters is a cause for embarrassment and can negatively impact their work and home life. Indeed, for many patients with underactive bladder, the emotional effects of the disease can feel just as devastating as the physical effects. And for older patients, it can have a major impact on quality of life. In fact, lss of bladder control is the second most common reason for nursing home placement of the elderly. Finding a way to stem these bladder issues would allow millions more older adults to remain independent and experience life without the worry and embarrassment associated with bladder control dysfunction. This important issue is below the radar of most experts and the public. The inaugural First Congress of Urologic Research and Education on Aging UnderActive Bladder (CURE-UAB) seeks to address this issue and will be held on February 20 and 21, 2014 in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area with target of 75-100 attendees. We are excited to organize and participate in this unprecedented event which will mark the first UAB symposium in the world. As the first and only planned meeting dedicated to the underactive bladder, the conference will create awareness for the aging UAB. This meeting is being planned based on a consensus of experts in the field spanning the medical disciplines of geriatric medicine, urology, gynecology and nursing. Moreover, we have already received the support and input of Beaumont, American Foundation of Urological Disease (AFUD), Society of Urological Nurses (SUNA), Geriatric Urological Society (GUS), and the Underactive Bladder Foundation. Impact: UAB is an expanding troublesome health issue of aging, exerting a major influence on the health and independence of older people with a disproportionally low level of attention received. CURE-UAB will organize the first ever international gathering of key stakeholders on this topic. Our team at Beaumont, with an experienced research team and expert collaborators, has the unique talent to successfully complete this project. With the support of the NIH, CURE-UAB will successfully educate the public, academic, industry and governmental stakeholders that can lead to the improved the healthcare for millions of Americans."

The specific aims of the program are to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality by accelerating the transfer of newly developed cancer prevention therapies, to improve early detection rates, and to facilitate patient treatment management, rehabilitation, and the dissemination of scientific results to the profession and to the general public. To facilitate this process B-CCOP is supported by a central office, an experienced Institutional Review Board, a dedicated investigational pharmacy, and a group of leadership committees commissioned to support protocol review and implementation, financial management and the CCOP goals and direction. Our mission: ""Cancer Clinical Trials Office at Beaumont Hospitals provides research to our community with dignity, compassion, hope and excellence in service"".   
  
RELEVANCE: B-CCOP's goal of increasing community oncologists' involvement in state of the art cancer prevention, control and treatment trials serving a wide segment of our population, including minorities, women, and other underserved populations continues to be relevant today. B-CCOP's community presence accelerates the transfer of knowledge gained from clinical trials to community oncology practices and our diverse population.

Patients rarely survive more than a year after the initial diagnosis, primarily due to the highly infiltrative/invasive behavior of these tumors, and their resistance to chemotherapy. The proposed studies arise from our efforts to understand the invasive properties of gliomas as an approach to identify unique therapeutic targets. One of the targets we have identified is Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), which is a matricellular protein that is secreted into the extracellular matrix. We have demonstrated that SPARC is highly expressed in gliomas, and that it promotes glioma invasion in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that SPARC induces migration and invasion via the activation of p38 MAPK-MAPKAPK2-HSP27 signaling pathway. HSP27 is a member of the small heat shock proteins that function to modulate the actin cytoskeleton and migration. We have demonstrated that inhibition of HSP27 suppresses SPARC-induced changes in cell morphology, migration and invasion in vitro in PTEN- null glioma cells. We have also demonstrated that the re-expression of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene commonly lost or mutated in glioblastomas, suppresses SPARC-induced migration in vitro and invasion in vivo. We therefore propose that PTEN loss enables SPARC-induced migration and invasion via phosphorylation of HSP27. To test this hypothesis we propose the following aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Characterize SPARC- induced activation of HSP27 in the absence or presence of PTEN in cell lines and human tissues. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine whether inhibition of HSP27 alone, or in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy, reduces tumor survival in vitro using tumor cells with different SPARC and PTEN status. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine whether inhibition of HSP27 alone, or in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy, reduces SPARC-induced tumor cell invasion and survival in vivo and increases animal survival, using tumor cells with different PTEN status. We propose that pHSP27 inhibition in the commonly occurring SPARC-positive, PTEN-deleted GBMs can have a significant impact on inhibiting glioma cell invasion and is an important clinical strategy for glioma patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging Underactive Bladder (UAB) is a complex constellation of symptoms that significantly decreases the quality of life of those affected, but there are very few treatment options. As a result, patients who suffer from UAB are managed with in-dwelling catheters, clean intermittent catheterization, or must wear diapers. Use of these devices creates immense difficulties and challenges for elderly individual and their caretakers. UAB patients using catheters to ensure the emptying of their bladders also face long-term medical difficulties, including inflammation and discomfort, the potential for injury, and an increased risk of bacterial infection. Urinary tract infections can lead to kidney damage and blood infections. In addition, for many individuals, the use of catheters is a cause for embarrassment and can negatively impact their work and home life.  Indeed, for many patients with underactive bladder, the emotional effects of the disease can feel just as devastating as the physical effects. And for older patients, it can have a major impact on quality of life. In fact, lss of bladder control is the second most common reason for nursing home placement of the elderly. Finding a way to stem these bladder issues would allow millions more older adults to remain independent and experience life without the worry and embarrassment associated with bladder control dysfunction. Yet, this important issue remains below the radar of most experts and the public.  The Congress of Urologic Research and Education on Aging UnderActive Bladder Series (CURE-UAB) seeks to continue to provide a forum for physicians, researchers, and public stakeholders to discuss and promote research and education on the aging UAB. Building off the success of the 1st CURE-UAB, which was supported, in part, by the NIA (1R13AG047010-01), the CURE-UAB Series will continue to educate and promote research as the only international forum to unite key stakeholders of UAB from the public, academia, industry, and government. The series will feature three additional meetings over a five year span in Denver, CO; Seattle, WA; and Washington DC. The series will be designed based on a consensus of experts in the field spanning the medical disciplines of geriatric medicine, urology, gynecology and nursing. Our team at Beaumont, with an experienced research team and expert collaborators including public and patient representation from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the Underactive Bladder Foundation, has the unique talent to successfully complete this project.

Although there are several therapeutic options available, behavioral treatments are recommended by most evidence-based guidelines as an initial approach to treatment for stress, urgency, and mixed UI. Behavioral treatments are usually delivered in individualized visits in medical offices, but a group session model of care delivery has been shown to be effective. Based on promising outcomes in our pilot studies using a novel group treatment approach, we were awarded a planning grant to assemble an interdisciplinary team of experts and develop a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed study is a three-site RCT to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group-administered behavioral treatment program to no treatment. Women with stress, urgency, or mixed UI will be recruited and screened centrally, evaluated clinically at each of three study sites, and randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:  1) Group behavioral treatment (GBT) or  2) No treatment. Outcomes will be assessed at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-randomization. The primary outcome will be self- reported UI severity as measured by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-UI Short Form (ICI-Q), a validated measure for research and practice. Secondary outcome measures will assess frequency of incontinence episodes, volume of urine loss, type of incontinence, pelvic floor muscle strength, patient satisfaction, patient perception of improvement, impact on quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Once standardized with data to support its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, group treatment modalities have potential to reach a larger population of older women with UI, not only in traditional medical settings, but also in community settings, significantly reducing the human and economic burden of UI on patients, health care providers, and the health care system as a whole.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoarthritis (OA), diagnosed in over 15% of the US population, is the primary cause of musculoskeletal lower extremity disability. Although there is no cure, exercise remains the core treatment to manage OA regardless of age, comorbidity, pain, severity or disability. Yet, many people with this condition do not engage in regular fitness
and thus may resort to invasive and risky joint replacement surgeries due to pain and decreased mobility, or they may experience health decline due to sedentary lifestyles. The goal of this Phase I STTR proposal is to complete the design, safety and usability testing of AFARI(tm), for use by individuals diagnosed with lower extremity OA. Created to fill an unmet need for populations who without adequate mobility support would be less likely, fully unable, or unwilling to participate in ambulatory exercise, AFARI is a three-wheeled device, and provides the mechanisms to unload body weight. AFARI was created to promote participation in outdoor walking, jogging, or running. Although durable medical equipment (DME) such as walkers, crutches and canes is available to those who need it, DME is minimally functional for outdoor exercise, and is often perceived as stigmatizing and inconvenient. Therefore, many people with lower-extremity OA abandon these devices. AFARI was designed to mitigate abandonment and eliminate a number of barriers to regular outdoor fitness activity by persons with lower-extremity OA. AFARI will allow the user to safely and successfully initiate, maintain, and/or increase the length and intensity of their exercise programs. In preliminary market research for AFARI, respondents indicated that form was as important as function and ease of use if they were to adopt AFARI and the device was designed with these principles in mind. Through this STTR effort, several major barriers to timely commercialization of AFARI will be researched so that they can be eliminated. The safety and stability of AFARI will be proven though mechanical testing and human evaluation. The weight bearing monitoring system will be concurrently validated against bodily weight bearing measures. An evaluation of the reduction in fall risk tested by fear of falling will be undertaken; Data on usability, destigmatizing design, and overall
desirability of AFARI will be collected, and, tasks will be planned to educate clinicians regarding
AFARI and its benefits. To accomplish the objective of this Phase I study, to demonstrate the initial feasibility of AFARI for people with lower extremity OA, such that we can proceed with expanded efforts in Phase II, four specific aims will be met: AIM 1) Validation of the functionalit and safety of AFARI; AIM 2) Concurrent validation of the weight bearing monitoring system; AIM 3) Conducting preliminary usability testing focusing on comfort, function, convenience, stigma reduction, and design preferences, and AIM 4) Planning for clinician education about AFARI.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy. The established approach for understanding the biology of these aggressive tumors in an effort to identify novel molecular targets has largely been genotype based. Unfortunately, clinical gains offered by this level of understanding have been limited, largely based on the complex nature of signaling networks associated with tumorigenesis and the inability to delineate the key ""functional"" signaling pathways actually driving growth in an individual tumor. While cancers have access to a wide variety of genetic and/or epigenetic modifications, there are a limited number of metabolic strategies that they can employ. The underlying hypotheses of our research are that (1) activation of specific metabolic programs are required during glioma tumorigenesis, and (2) these pathways are targetable. We recently performed global metabolomic profiling in ~70 gliomas with liquid and gas chromatography (LC/GC) coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry (MS) using a metabolomic library consisting of >2000 standards in an effort to identify unique metabolic programs utilized by GBM. A key discovery was the identification of the accumulation of the metabolic intermediate cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) in GBM, which ranked as the metabolite with the highest relative accumulation when compared to Grade II glioma. This represents the first identification of this metabolite in the context of cancer biology. We went on to optimize assays to quantify CSA levels in tissue, confirmed activation of this metabolic signaling axis in both patient derived tumors and GBM cell lines, and established its role in adapting to hypoxia. In the proposed study, we now seek to validate this metabolic node using flux-based studies and determine its potential to serve as a novel molecular target in GBM.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI), accounting for
12% of all HAIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has labeled CDI as one of three urgent
health threats that require immediate and aggressive action, as CDI is responsible for more than 450,000
hospitalizations and 29,000 deaths per year. Patients over 65 years old are most commonly affected and have
the highest mortality. C. difficile causes disease through production of toxins, and the increase in incidence,
severity, and mortality is in part due to the spread of a hypervirulent strain (NAP/BI/027) that produces more
toxin. Pre-existing colonization with toxigenic C. difficile is a risk factor for developing CDI. Use of antibiotics
that disrupt the protective normal colonic flora is the single largest risk factor for both C. difficile colonization
and CDI.
Current strategies to prevent CDI involve infection control measures to prevent transmission of C. difficile and
antibiotic stewardship to control antibiotic use. Ultimately, however, infection control cannot prevent cases of
CDI in patients already colonized. Thus, new measures need to be developed to identify patients at risk for CDI
due to toxigenic colonization and prevent progression to disease.
To date, no studies have considered primary prophylaxis as an approach to preventing CDI in appropriate
patients, despite the fact that prophylaxis is a universally accepted method of preventing other diverse
infections. In this study, we propose to screen patients who are initiating a course of antibiotics considered high
risk for CDI to determine who is colonized with toxigenic C. difficile and, therefore, at risk of developing CDI.
We hypothesize that the most effective and affordable intervention in the colonized patient population is
prophylactic treatment with vancomycin, which is efficacious against C. difficile. Our goal for this study is to
implement a first-of-its-kind clinical trial with the following specific aims:
 1) Determine the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile colonization among the inpatient population treated with
 high-risk antibiotics and the incidence of CDI in these patients with respect to their state of colonization with
 C. difficile; and
 2) Determine the effect of vancomycin prophylaxis on patients receiving high-risk antibiotics who are
 colonized with toxigenic C. difficile based on molecular testing.
This clinical trial has the potential to cause transformative change in the methodology of preventing CDI and
alter the standard of care when using high-risk antibiotics in the hospital setting. This is a significant
contribution; this cost effective and easily implemented intervention has the potential to reverse the increasing
incidence of CDI and associated mortality rates, decrease the economic burden associated with the disease,
and improve patient quality of life with minimal discomfort and adverse impact to patients."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging Underactive Bladder (UAB) is a complex constellation of symptoms that significantly decreases the quality of life of those affected, but there are very few treatment options. As a result, patients who suffer from UAB are managed with in-dwelling catheters, clean intermittent catheterization, or must wear diapers. Use of these devices creates immense difficulties and challenges for elderly individual and their caretakers. UAB patients using catheters to ensure the emptying of their bladders also face long-term medical difficulties, including inflammation and discomfort, the potential for injury, and an increased risk of bacterial infection. Urinary tract infections can lead to kidney damage and blood infections. In addition, for many individuals, the use of catheters is a cause for embarrassment and can negatively impact their work and home life.  Indeed, for many patients with underactive bladder, the emotional effects of the disease can feel just as devastating as the physical effects.

RC is a debilitating
bladder and may be life-threatening. Current therapies are inadequate and can have severe life changing side-effects.
The absence of reliable treatment and early diagnostic markers is in part due to limited comprehension of the
histological and molecular changes associated with the progression of this condition.
 I hypothesize that radiation-induced damage to the bladder vasculature drives the chronic inflammation,
fibrosis and hematuria associated with RC. This hypothesis will be addressed through three specific aims: 1.
Determine the effect of radiation therapy on bladder vasculature function, 2. Assess and target the inflammation in an
animal model of RC, and 3. Validate urinary candidate biomarkers for early detection of RC.
 The study design includes assessing functional changes of endothelial cells and determining changes in
ICAM-1 expression and its role in immune cell recruitment in response to irradiation. Non-irradiated and
cyclophosphamide treated cells will serve as negative and positive controls respectively. Using a mouse model of RC,
a timeline of molecular and histological bladder changes in response to radiation will be determined. Non-irradiated
bladders and cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in mice will be used as negative and positive controls for these
studies respectively. Finally urine samples from RC patients with a history of prostate or cervical cancer will be used
to develop a biomarker for RC. Controls consist of age-matched male and female urine samples.
 As a cancer survivor and a scientist, my ultimate career goal is to improve the quality of life of cancer
survivors through my research. I plan on achieving this goal by becoming an independent translation investigator,
focusing my research on urological complications from cancer therapies, and implementing my research findings into
the clinic.
 Through my past research track record, I have extensive experience in basic science techniques in vascular
and cancer biology. The additional necessary skills to successfully complete this research and training proposal will
be acquired through mentorship and coursework in translational research, radiation, and biostatistics. In addition, I
will be receiving practical training in viral infections and pathology. I will be receiving continuous mentorship from
Drs. Chancellor and Lamb. Drs. Kanai and Wilson will serve as co-mentors. My mentors have a history of successful
mentorship of NIH scientists and we have a superb and supportive training environment here at Beaumont Research
Institute and Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.
 The outcome of our studies can significantly improve the quality of life of many cancer survivors that are
suffering with severe bladder complications due to radiation therapy. These studies could lead to finding effective

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI), accounting for
12% of all HAIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has labeled CDI as one of three urgent
health threats that require immediate and aggressive action, as CDI is responsible for more than 450,000
hospitalizations and 29,000 deaths per year. Patients over 65 years old are most commonly affected and have
the highest mortality. C. difficile causes disease through production of toxins, and the increase in incidence,
severity, and mortality is in part due to the spread of a hypervirulent strain (NAP/BI/027) that produces more
toxin. Pre-existing colonization with toxigenic C. difficile is a risk factor for developing CDI. Use of antibiotics
that disrupt the protective normal colonic flora is the single largest risk factor for both C. difficile colonization
and CDI.
Current strategies to prevent CDI involve infection control measures to prevent transmission of C. difficile and
antibiotic stewardship to control antibiotic use. Ultimately, however, infection control cannot prevent cases of
CDI in patients already colonized. Thus, new measures need to be developed to identify patients at risk for CDI
due to toxigenic colonization and prevent progression to disease.
To date, no studies have considered primary prophylaxis as an approach to preventing CDI in appropriate
patients, despite the fact that prophylaxis is a universally accepted method of preventing other diverse
infections. In this study, we propose to screen patients who are initiating a course of antibiotics considered high
risk for CDI to determine who is colonized with toxigenic C. difficile and, therefore, at risk of developing CDI.
We hypothesize that the most effective and affordable intervention in the colonized patient population is
prophylactic treatment with vancomycin, which is efficacious against C. difficile. Our goal for this study is to
implement a first-of-its-kind clinical trial with the following specific aims:
 1) Determine the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile colonization among the inpatient population treated with
 high-risk antibiotics and the incidence of CDI in these patients with respect to their state of colonization with
 C. difficile; and
 2) Determine the effect of vancomycin prophylaxis on patients receiving high-risk antibiotics who are
 colonized with toxigenic C. difficile based on molecular testing.
This clinical trial has the potential to cause transformative change in the methodology of preventing CDI and
alter the standard of care when using high-risk antibiotics in the hospital setting. This is a significant
contribution; this cost effective and easily implemented intervention has the potential to reverse the increasing
incidence of CDI and associated mortality rates, decrease the economic burden associated with the disease,
and improve patient quality of life with minimal discomfort and adverse impact to patients."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging Underactive Bladder (UAB) is a complex constellation of symptoms that significantly decreases the quality of life of those affected, but there are very few treatment options. As a result, patients who suffer from UAB are managed with in-dwelling catheters, clean intermittent catheterization, or must wear diapers. Use of these devices creates immense difficulties and challenges for elderly individual and their caretakers. UAB patients using catheters to ensure the emptying of their bladders also face long-term medical difficulties, including inflammation and discomfort, the potential for injury, and an increased risk of bacterial infection. Urinary tract infections can lead to kidney damage and blood infections. In addition, for many individuals, the use of catheters is a cause for embarrassment and can negatively impact their work and home life.  Indeed, for many patients with underactive bladder, the emotional effects of the disease can feel just as devastating as the physical effects. And for older patients, it can have a major impact on quality of life. In fact, lss of bladder control is the second most common reason for nursing home placement of the elderly. Finding a way to stem these bladder issues would allow millions more older adults to remain independent and experience life without the worry and embarrassment associated with bladder control dysfunction. Yet, this important issue remains below the radar of most experts and the public.  The Congress of Urologic Research and Education on Aging UnderActive Bladder Series (CURE-UAB) seeks to continue to provide a forum for physicians, researchers, and public stakeholders to discuss and promote research and education on the aging UAB. Building off the success of the 1st CURE-UAB, which was supported, in part, by the NIA (1R13AG047010-01), the CURE-UAB Series will continue to educate and promote research as the only international forum to unite key stakeholders of UAB from the public, academia, industry, and government. The series will feature three additional meetings over a five year span in Denver, CO; Seattle, WA; and Washington DC. The series will be designed based on a consensus of experts in the field spanning the medical disciplines of geriatric medicine, urology, gynecology and nursing. Our team at Beaumont, with an experienced research team and expert collaborators including public and patient representation from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the Underactive Bladder Foundation, has the unique talent to successfully complete this project."

RC is a debilitating
bladder and may be life-threatening. Current therapies are inadequate and can have severe life changing side-effects.
The absence of reliable treatment and early diagnostic markers is in part due to limited comprehension of the
histological and molecular changes associated with the progression of this condition.
 I hypothesize that radiation-induced damage to the bladder vasculature drives the chronic inflammation,
fibrosis and hematuria associated with RC. This hypothesis will be addressed through three specific aims: 1.
Determine the effect of radiation therapy on bladder vasculature function, 2. Assess and target the inflammation in an
animal model of RC, and 3. Validate urinary candidate biomarkers for early detection of RC.
 The study design includes assessing functional changes of endothelial cells and determining changes in
ICAM-1 expression and its role in immune cell recruitment in response to irradiation. Non-irradiated and
cyclophosphamide treated cells will serve as negative and positive controls respectively. Using a mouse model of RC,
a timeline of molecular and histological bladder changes in response to radiation will be determined. Non-irradiated
bladders and cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in mice will be used as negative and positive controls for these
studies respectively. Finally urine samples from RC patients with a history of prostate or cervical cancer will be used
to develop a biomarker for RC. Controls consist of age-matched male and female urine samples.
 As a cancer survivor and a scientist, my ultimate career goal is to improve the quality of life of cancer
survivors through my research. I plan on achieving this goal by becoming an independent translation investigator,
focusing my research on urological complications from cancer therapies, and implementing my research findings into
the clinic.
 Through my past research track record, I have extensive experience in basic science techniques in vascular
and cancer biology. The additional necessary skills to successfully complete this research and training proposal will
be acquired through mentorship and coursework in translational research, radiation, and biostatistics. In addition, I
will be receiving practical training in viral infections and pathology. I will be receiving continuous mentorship from
Drs. Chancellor and Lamb. Drs. Kanai and Wilson will serve as co-mentors. My mentors have a history of successful
mentorship of NIH scientists and we have a superb and supportive training environment here at Beaumont Research
Institute and Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.
 The outcome of our studies can significantly improve the quality of life of many cancer survivors that are
suffering with severe bladder complications due to radiation therapy. These studies could lead to finding effective
therapy for RC as well as a urine biomarker for early detection of RC. This research study has great potential to
improve the quality of life of cancer survivors suffering from this debilitating condition."

Glioblastoma (GBM) continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy with limited treatment options. Our
laboratory studies tumor metabolism and its potential to serve as a novel therapeutic target. Through a series
of investigations, our group has identified that the diverse tumor ecology implicit in this malignancy contributes
to considerable intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity and dynamic metabolic reprogramming, allowing GBM
cells to adapt and proliferate under diverse, microenvironmental stresses. Specifically, through integrative
cross-platform analyses coupling metabolomics with genomics in patient-derived tumors, we identified
enhanced fatty acid oxidization (FAO) as a metabolic node in GBM driven by a transcriptional program
designed to import and utilize fatty acids from the tumor microenvironment. This metabolic phenotype was
specific to the mesenchymal subtype in GBM and recapitulated in preclinical models. Functional analyses
uncovered specific roles these fatty acids play in gliomagenesis, which are dependent upon nutrient
availability. In a state of glucose deprivation, mesenchymal GBM cells utilize these exogenous fatty acids to
serve as a vital, alternate source of ATP, whereas in nutrient favorable conditions, the intermediary metabolism
of FAO acts as a metabolic cue to drive a transcriptional program supporting cellular proliferation and
mesenchymal differentiation. Accordingly, inhibiting FAO in standard, nutrient rich conditions led to decreased
proliferation, however, robust energetic stress and non-apoptotic cell death was observed in mesenchymal
GBM cells in the context of glucose deprivation. In this application, we propose to extend these promising
findings by defining molecular mechanisms governing enhanced FAO in GBM (Aim 1), delineating the multiple
roles FAO may play in gliomagenesis in the context of this tumorâ€™s diverse tumor ecology (Aim 2), and evaluate
the translational potential for eliciting metabolic synthetic lethality in GBM through energetic stress (Aim 3)."

surgery and anesthesia can precipitate delirium. The prevalence of postoperative delirium depends on type of
surgery, but an overall postoperative incidence of 17% is a reasonable estimate. The pathophysiological
mechanisms that underpin postoperative delirium and its sequelae have yet to be systematically studied. Certain
pathways may account for the development of delirium itself, while others may drive longer-term cognitive
outcomes such as progression of dementia. The degree to which these interrelate, are separate or shared is
completely unknown. One approach to investigate the neural basis of delirium has been to use CSF samples
obtained through regional anesthesia. We propose investigating the neural basis of delirium by using CSF
samples obtained in the course of spinal anesthesia, combining biomarkers with clinical and demographic
information. Our preliminary data indicates arginine metabolism may be a predictor of delirium in CSF. In this
study we aim to extend on our previous work, and accurately quantify all arginine related metabolites and
complement this data set with protein expression levels for this metabolic cascade. Our goal is to develop a
comprehensive picture of arginine metabolism in CSF and correlate these results with current pathophysiological
biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Further, having extended our biochemical coverage of arginine metabolism,
we will develop novel biomarkers capable of predicting those patients at greatest risk of developing delirium and
subsequent cognitive decline. Having defined the biochemical signature of delirium, it will be important to
determine which patients later developed dementia and/or significant neurodegeneration following surgery.
Therefore, we will complete a long term follow up of our original patients to determine who developed Alzheimerâ€™s
disease or one of its related dementias and correlate those findings with our results. Moreover, and to ensure
the validity of our delirium biomarker panel, we will prospectively recruit participants undergoing planned joint
replacement surgery at Beaumont Health (>4,000 at Beaumont Royal Oak, 2018), perform pre-operative clinical
and cognitive assessments and postoperative delirium screening. Having access to such a large and diverse
patient population will provide the us with an optimal, independent validation set. In summary, our overarching
goals for this proposal are to: (i) develop an existing collaboration with the largest CSF-delirium repository to
date (n=358) in order to extend on current findings; (ii) develop new biomarker panels; (iii) perform a long term
follow up of our initial cohort and (iv) validate our findings in a large and diverse US based population."

 1) Determine the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile colonization among the inpatient population treated with
 high-risk antibiotics and the incidence of CDI in these patients with respect to their state of colonization with
 C. difficile; and
 2) Determine the effect of vancomycin prophylaxis on patients receiving high-risk antibiotics who are
 colonized with toxigenic C. difficile based on molecular testing.
This clinical trial has the potential to cause transformative change in the methodology of preventing CDI and
alter the standard of care when using high-risk antibiotics in the hospital setting. This is a significant
contribution; this cost effective and easily implemented intervention has the potential to reverse the increasing
incidence of CDI and associated mortality rates, decrease the economic burden associated with the disease,
and improve patient quality of life with minimal discomfort and adverse impact to patients."

Glioblastoma (GBM) continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy with limited treatment options. Our
laboratory studies tumor metabolism and its potential to serve as a novel therapeutic target. Through a series
of investigations, our group has identified that the diverse tumor ecology implicit in this malignancy contributes
to considerable intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity and dynamic metabolic reprogramming, allowing GBM
cells to adapt and proliferate under diverse, microenvironmental stresses. Specifically, through integrative
cross-platform analyses coupling metabolomics with genomics in patient-derived tumors, we identified
enhanced fatty acid oxidization (FAO) as a metabolic node in GBM driven by a transcriptional program
designed to import and utilize fatty acids from the tumor microenvironment. This metabolic phenotype was
specific to the mesenchymal subtype in GBM and recapitulated in preclinical models. Functional analyses
uncovered specific roles these fatty acids play in gliomagenesis, which are dependent upon nutrient
availability. In a state of glucose deprivation, mesenchymal GBM cells utilize these exogenous fatty acids to
serve as a vital, alternate source of ATP, whereas in nutrient favorable conditions, the intermediary metabolism
of FAO acts as a metabolic cue to drive a transcriptional program supporting cellular proliferation and
mesenchymal differentiation. Accordingly, inhibiting FAO in standard, nutrient rich conditions led to decreased
proliferation, however, robust energetic stress and non-apoptotic cell death was observed in mesenchymal
GBM cells in the context of glucose deprivation. In this application, we propose to extend these promising
findings by defining molecular mechanisms governing enhanced FAO in GBM (Aim 1), delineating the multiple
roles FAO may play in gliomagenesis in the context of this tumorâ€™s diverse tumor ecology (Aim 2), and evaluate
the translational potential for eliciting metabolic synthetic lethality in GBM through energetic stress (Aim 3)."

RC is a debilitating
bladder and may be life-threatening. Current therapies are inadequate and can have severe life changing side-effects.
The absence of reliable treatment and early diagnostic markers is in part due to limited comprehension of the
histological and molecular changes associated with the progression of this condition.
 I hypothesize that radiation-induced damage to the bladder vasculature drives the chronic inflammation,
fibrosis and hematuria associated with RC. This hypothesis will be addressed through three specific aims: 1.
Determine the effect of radiation therapy on bladder vasculature function, 2. Assess and target the inflammation in an
animal model of RC, and 3. Validate urinary candidate biomarkers for early detection of RC.
 The study design includes assessing functional changes of endothelial cells and determining changes in
ICAM-1 expression and its role in immune cell recruitment in response to irradiation. Non-irradiated and
cyclophosphamide treated cells will serve as negative and positive controls respectively. Using a mouse model of RC,
a timeline of molecular and histological bladder changes in response to radiation will be determined. Non-irradiated
bladders and cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in mice will be used as negative and positive controls for these
studies respectively. Finally urine samples from RC patients with a history of prostate or cervical cancer will be used
to develop a biomarker for RC. Controls consist of age-matched male and female urine samples.
 As a cancer survivor and a scientist, my ultimate career goal is to improve the quality of life of cancer
survivors through my research. I plan on achieving this goal by becoming an independent translation investigator,
focusing my research on urological complications from cancer therapies, and implementing my research findings into
the clinic.
 Through my past research track record, I have extensive experience in basic science techniques in vascular
and cancer biology. The additional necessary skills to successfully complete this research and training proposal will
be acquired through mentorship and coursework in translational research, radiation, and biostatistics. In addition, I
will be receiving practical training in viral infections and pathology. I will be receiving continuous mentorship from
Drs. Chancellor and Lamb. Drs. Kanai and Wilson will serve as co-mentors. My mentors have a history of successful
mentorship of NIH scientists and we have a superb and supportive training environment here at Beaumont Research
Institute and Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.
 The outcome of our studies can significantly improve the quality of life of many cancer survivors that are
suffering with severe bladder complications due to radiation therapy. These studies could lead to finding effective
therapy for RC as well as a urine biomarker for early detection of RC. This research study has great potential to
improve the quality of life of cancer survivors suffering from this debilitating condition."

The Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan (CRCWM) is an NCI Community Oncology
Research Program (NCORP) comprised of nine major health systems, a renowned basic
science institute, and a medical school. CRCWM covers the west half of Michigan and cares for
almost 14,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients and their families per year. Formed from two
experienced Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs) in 2014, CRCWM has a 40+
year history of bringing clinical trials to the community and is a major accruer to NCI studies.
With over 100 oncology physician investigators and a well-established administrative staff,
CRCWM has the ability to enroll patients with cancer diagnoses across the continuum and to
address NCI goals of expanding participation of racial/ethnic minorities and underserved in
clinical trials. This application reiterates our commitment to high-quality research and ongoing
alignment with NCI initiatives.
We are well-positioned to achieve our specific aims for the next NCORP grant cycle which are:
1. To maximize accrual of patients to cancer clinical trials sponsored by the National
 Cancer Institute including priority studies for cancer control/prevention,
 molecular/precision medicine, and imaging.
2. To be strong contributors to Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR).
3. To maximize the sharing of NCI scientific findings into clinical care through education
 and engagement of clinical partners and health systems.
4. To address health care disparities experienced by underserved (e.g., rural,
 adolescent/young adult, elderly, minority and underinsured) populations within our
communities.
5. To optimize our contribution to the national scientific research agenda by expanding our
 leadership and committee participation in the National Clinical Trials Network
 (NCTN)/NCORP research bases and the mentoring of young investigators."

 The Michigan Interdisciplinary Center for Urology Research and Education (MI-CURE) seeks
to develop a world-class interdisciplinary research team comprised of scientists, clinicians, biostatisticians,
and engineers to provide comprehensive and innovative approaches in benign urology. As such, we have
brought together exceptional investigators with diverse expertise from Beaumont Hospital/ Oakland
University William Beaumont School of Medicine and Michigan State University.
 The overall purpose of the MI-CURE Exploratory Center is to establish strong research foundations
in bladder physiology, develop an intellectual infrastructure, and expand educational and training
opportunities in benign urology research. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms by which bladder
fullness is sensed are still unknown. A major barrier to developing and testing novel therapies for bladder
dysfunction is our lack of understanding the mechanism of how bladder fullness is sensed. Thus, the overall
goal of this initial project is to understand the basis of pressure sensing and its linkage to afferent nerve
activation during bladder filling, and consequently how bladder remodeling and altered bladder wall
compliance during disease can impact these mechanisms. To address this significant knowledge gap, we
have assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts in physiology, cell biology, fibrosis, neurourology,
statistics, and clinical urology and have recruited a promising new investigator in engineering to benign
genitourinary disease, Dr. Sara Roccabianca. She has unique expertise in soft tissue mechanical
characterization, microstructural quantification, and mathematical modeling of soft tissues movement.
 In addition to the strong benign urology research program using innovative and cutting-edge
approaches, MI-CURE has an exciting Educational Enrichment Program to train and mentor all levels of
adult learners, from high school students to medical students, to help expand and enhance benign urology
research. MI-CURE is co-directed by the established physician-scientist team of Drs. Laura Lamb and
Michael Chancellor, with clear communication and coordination plans in place. Together, MI-CURE will
foster successful collaborations, education initiatives, and innovative research.
 Funding of MI-CURE as a P20 Exploratory Center will allow us to work with the George M. O'Brien
Urology Cooperative Research Centers Program and the KURe and UroEpi career development programs
through joint meetings and conference calls. Our goal is to leverage our collective resources and results
into well-designed, novel projects suitable for submission as future NIH Investigator-Initiated R01s. We
believe that the Michigan Interdisciplinary Center for Urology Research and Education program as a whole
will be greater than the sum of its parts and will contribute to developing talented researchers in benign
genitourinary disorders."

 Bladder dysfunction is the costliest lower urinary tract disorder and one of the top three negative

We propose the novel overarching concept that: (1) localized bladder wall contractions drive afferent

changes in wall tension cannot occur. In essence, we propose that it is the changes in wall tension â€“ not
the transient contraction itself â€“ that drive afferent outflow during filling. Thus, any change in wall
compliance would have significant effects on the sensation of bladder fullness. This concept focuses solely
on the mechanical properties of the bladder, without speculation as to the role(s) of different cell types
involved in the signaling itself. By first understanding how bladder wall compliance alters sensation, we can
then delve deeper into the mechanisms by which compliance is changed, thereby improving our working
knowledge of bladder dysfunction. The specific aims are: 1) Determine the composition and mechanical
properties of both the decellularized extracellular matrix and the intact urinary bladder; and 2) Elucidate the

Glioblastoma (GBM) continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy with limited treatment options. Our
laboratory studies tumor metabolism and its potential to serve as a novel therapeutic target. Through a series
of investigations, our group has identified that the diverse tumor ecology implicit in this malignancy contributes
to considerable intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity and dynamic metabolic reprogramming, allowing GBM
cells to adapt and proliferate under diverse, microenvironmental stresses. Specifically, through integrative
cross-platform analyses coupling metabolomics with genomics in patient-derived tumors, we identified
enhanced fatty acid oxidization (FAO) as a metabolic node in GBM driven by a transcriptional program
designed to import and utilize fatty acids from the tumor microenvironment. This metabolic phenotype was
specific to the mesenchymal subtype in GBM and recapitulated in preclinical models. Functional analyses
uncovered specific roles these fatty acids play in gliomagenesis, which are dependent upon nutrient
availability. In a state of glucose deprivation, mesenchymal GBM cells utilize these exogenous fatty acids to
serve as a vital, alternate source of ATP, whereas in nutrient favorable conditions, the intermediary metabolism
of FAO acts as a metabolic cue to drive a transcriptional program supporting cellular proliferation and
mesenchymal differentiation. Accordingly, inhibiting FAO in standard, nutrient rich conditions led to decreased
proliferation, however, robust energetic stress and non-apoptotic cell death was observed in mesenchymal
GBM cells in the context of glucose deprivation. In this application, we propose to extend these promising
findings by defining molecular mechanisms governing enhanced FAO in GBM (Aim 1), delineating the multiple

(AEs) is critical to ensure the safety of vaccines. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) is a national vaccine safety surveillance program which contains spontaneous reports from

In response to the FOA, PA-18-873, this proposal addresses the specific objective:
â€œcreation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data
available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases.â€
We propose to develop a series of methods for vaccine safety surveillance while incorporating
adverse event ontology as well as vaccine ontology. Specifically, we will use the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the vaccine ontology (VO) to form the basis of our models for
systematically mining and monitoring safety signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to directly incorporate AE and vaccine ontologies in the signal detection method. Multiple AEs
may individually be rare enough to go undetected, but if they are related, they can borrow strength
from each other to increase the chance of being flagged. Furthermore, borrowing strength induces
shrinkage of related AEs, thereby also reducing headline-grabbing false positives. Additionally,
multiple AEs may collectively point to an underlying adverse cause, combined with additional expert

Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States, though many of them pay a heavy price for
their survivorship status due to long-term side effects from cancer therapies. Radiation cystitis (RC) results
from radiation therapy for pelvic cancers. RC is a debilitating and progressive bladder condition with no
effective therapy that may be life-threatening. Thus, the treatment that killed the cancer, may ultimately kill
the cancer survivor as well. Research in cancer survivorship is highly significant and represent a great
unmet need. This grant proposal is greatly innovative and results from our studies may lead to new
diagnosis and treatment for radiation cystitis.
The PI, Bernadette Zwaans, PhD, completed a successful and productive NIDDK K01 training award. The
KO1 was focused on a systematic research on better understanding of radiation cystitis using SARRP at
the capable and resourceful environment at Beaumont Research Institute. We developed an RC
preclinical model that closely mimics the human condition. In this model, we identified that RC is a biphasic
condition, characterized by urothelial damage in the weeks after radiation therapy (=acute RC), and by
chronic fibrosis, vascular damage, and loss of detrusor muscle in months to years after radiation therapy (=
chronic RC). We have identified Amphiregulin (AREG) to be significantly elevated after radiation therapy,
and to continue to grow in abundance over time. AREG is a member of the epidermal growth factor family
that binds the EGF receptor. It has been implicated in many processes including tissue regeneration,
cancer, tissue fibrosis, and cellular senescence. AREG is present throughout the body but is most
prominently expressed in the bladder urothelium. We hypothesize that AREG mediates radiation-induced
bladder fibrosis and can serve as a potential therapeutic target. We further hypothesize that AREG
can serve as a predictive urine biomarker to identify patients that are at risk for developing chronic
RC.
Our hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1. Determine the expression pattern of AREG
and its importance in maintaining urothelial integrity in normal and irradiated bladder; 2. Determine the role
of AREG in mediating radiation-induced fibrosis; 3. Assess AREG as a predictive biomarker for RC. Given
our experience with RC preclinical models our team is well-suited to successfully complete these aims.
This study is investigating the first potential therapeutic target for RC and its use as a predictive urine
biomarker. The outcomes of our studies can significantly improve the quality of life of many cancer
survivors suffering from severe bladder complications due to radiation therapy. Thus, this study falls within
the mission statement of the NIDDK to improve health and quality of life of cancer survivors."

The Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan (CRCWM) is an NCI Community Oncology
Research Program (NCORP) comprised of nine major health systems, a renowned basic
science institute, and a medical school. CRCWM covers the west half of Michigan and cares for
almost 14,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients and their families per year. Formed from two
experienced Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs) in 2014, CRCWM has a 40+
year history of bringing clinical trials to the community and is a major accruer to NCI studies.
With over 100 oncology physician investigators and a well-established administrative staff,
CRCWM has the ability to enroll patients with cancer diagnoses across the continuum and to
address NCI goals of expanding participation of racial/ethnic minorities and underserved in
clinical trials. This application reiterates our commitment to high-quality research and ongoing
alignment with NCI initiatives.
We are well-positioned to achieve our specific aims for the next NCORP grant cycle which are:
1. To maximize accrual of patients to cancer clinical trials sponsored by the National
 Cancer Institute including priority studies for cancer control/prevention,
 molecular/precision medicine, and imaging.
2. To be strong contributors to Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR).
3. To maximize the sharing of NCI scientific findings into clinical care through education
 and engagement of clinical partners and health systems.
4. To address health care disparities experienced by underserved (e.g., rural,
 adolescent/young adult, elderly, minority and underinsured) populations within our
communities.
5. To optimize our contribution to the national scientific research agenda by expanding our
 leadership and committee participation in the National Clinical Trials Network

surgery and anesthesia can precipitate delirium. The prevalence of postoperative delirium depends on type of
surgery, but an overall postoperative incidence of 17% is a reasonable estimate. The pathophysiological
mechanisms that underpin postoperative delirium and its sequelae have yet to be systematically studied. Certain
pathways may account for the development of delirium itself, while others may drive longer-term cognitive
outcomes such as progression of dementia. The degree to which these interrelate, are separate or shared is
completely unknown. One approach to investigate the neural basis of delirium has been to use CSF samples
obtained through regional anesthesia. We propose investigating the neural basis of delirium by using CSF
samples obtained in the course of spinal anesthesia, combining biomarkers with clinical and demographic
information. Our preliminary data indicates arginine metabolism may be a predictor of delirium in CSF. In this
study we aim to extend on our previous work, and accurately quantify all arginine related metabolites and
complement this data set with protein expression levels for this metabolic cascade. Our goal is to develop a
comprehensive picture of arginine metabolism in CSF and correlate these results with current pathophysiological
biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Further, having extended our biochemical coverage of arginine metabolism,
we will develop novel biomarkers capable of predicting those patients at greatest risk of developing delirium and
subsequent cognitive decline. Having defined the biochemical signature of delirium, it will be important to
determine which patients later developed dementia and/or significant neurodegeneration following surgery.
Therefore, we will complete a long term follow up of our original patients to determine who developed Alzheimerâ€™s
disease or one of its related dementias and correlate those findings with our results. Moreover, and to ensure
the validity of our delirium biomarker panel, we will prospectively recruit participants undergoing planned joint
replacement surgery at Beaumont Health (>4,000 at Beaumont Royal Oak, 2018), perform pre-operative clinical
and cognitive assessments and postoperative delirium screening. Having access to such a large and diverse
patient population will provide the us with an optimal, independent validation set. In summary, our overarching
goals for this proposal are to: (i) develop an existing collaboration with the largest CSF-delirium repository to
date (n=358) in order to extend on current findings; (ii) develop new biomarker panels; (iii) perform a long term
follow up of our initial cohort and (iv) validate our findings in a large and diverse US based population."

Pelvic pain syndromes are one of the most prevalent and challenging conditions for clinicians today. They have
a higher incidence in women than men and are estimated to affect 6.4 â€“ 25.4% of adult women worldwide.
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as nonmalignant persistent pain perceived in structures or organs of the
pelvis for at least 6 months and can have a wide variety of etiologies. CPP has a debilitating effect on quality
of life, equivalent to those on dialysis, and is associated with psychological comorbidity including depression,
anxiety, and sleep disorders. Identifying the origin of the pelvic pain is typically the first step when choosing a
treatment strategy. However, identifying the etiology can be challenging in part because pain associated with
CPP is thought to become centralized over time and the dysfunction of one organ system often resulting in
pathologies in other organs.
Given the complex co-morbid conditions that define the phenotype of most patients with CPP, any treatment
that may potentially improve several downstream pelvic organs and/or symptoms is desirable. As such, we
propose to use sacral neuromodulation (SNM) as a treatment for CPP. SNM is a safe, effective, and minimally
invasive procedure used to treat urinary and fecal incontinence, frequency, urgency, and urinary retention.
Numerous retrospective studies have demonstrated a reduction in pelvic pain as a secondary outcome
measure with SNM. However, to date, no prospective placebo-controlled trial has been performed to assess
the effectiveness of SNM for pelvic pain specifically, in part because SNM is currently not an FDA approved
treatment for CPP. Thus, we hypothesize that sacral neuromodulation is effective at reducing pain in
patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We further hypothesize that single stage SNM
implantation is more cost-effective and provides higher benefit to pelvic pain patients than the
standard-of-care 2-stage approach.
Our hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1. Assess effectiveness of SNM in treating chronic
pelvic pain syndrome in women; 2. Evaluate cost-effectiveness of single stage versus standard-of-care
2-stage SNM. Beaumont Urology is internationally recognized for its expertise in neuromodulation and a large
number of women with CPP seek care at our Womenâ€™s Urology Center annually. Thus, our team is well-suited
to successfully complete these aims.
The outcomes of this study will have a far-reaching impact as it has the potential to significantly improve care
for CPP and simultaneously address many unknowns in the field of neuromodulation, such as determine the
placebo and carry-over effects. As such, study falls within the mission of this RFA to foster new and improved
treatment and pain management strategies for patients and to address specific NIDDK disorders of key
importance, namely Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome."

mechanisms that underpin postoperative delirium and its sequelae have yet to be systematically studied. Certain
pathways may account for the development of delirium itself, while others may drive longer-term cognitive
outcomes such as progression of dementia. The degree to which these interrelate, are separate or shared is
completely unknown. One approach to investigate the neural basis of delirium has been to use CSF samples
obtained through regional anesthesia. We propose investigating the neural basis of delirium by using CSF
samples obtained in the course of spinal anesthesia, combining biomarkers with clinical and demographic
information. Our preliminary data indicates arginine metabolism may be a predictor of delirium in CSF. In this
study we aim to extend on our previous work, and accurately quantify all arginine related metabolites and
complement this data set with protein expression levels for this metabolic cascade. Our goal is to develop a
comprehensive picture of arginine metabolism in CSF and correlate these results with current pathophysiological
biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Further, having extended our biochemical coverage of arginine metabolism,
we will develop novel biomarkers capable of predicting those patients at greatest risk of developing delirium and
subsequent cognitive decline. Having defined the biochemical signature of delirium, it will be important to
determine which patients later developed dementia and/or significant neurodegeneration following surgery.
Therefore, we will complete a long term follow up of our original patients to determine who developed Alzheimerâ€™s
disease or one of its related dementias and correlate those findings with our results. Moreover, and to ensure
the validity of our delirium biomarker panel, we will prospectively recruit participants undergoing planned joint
replacement surgery at Beaumont Health (>4,000 at Beaumont Royal Oak, 2018), perform pre-operative clinical
and cognitive assessments and postoperative delirium screening. Having access to such a large and diverse
patient population will provide the us with an optimal, independent validation set. In summary, our overarching
goals for this proposal are to: (i) develop an existing collaboration with the largest CSF-delirium repository to
date (n=358) in order to extend on current findings; (ii) develop new biomarker panels; (iii) perform a long term
follow up of our initial cohort and (iv) validate our findings in a large and diverse US based population."

Pelvic pain syndromes are one of the most prevalent and challenging conditions for clinicians today. They have
a higher incidence in women than men and are estimated to affect 6.4 â€“ 25.4% of adult women worldwide.
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as nonmalignant persistent pain perceived in structures or organs of the
pelvis for at least 6 months and can have a wide variety of etiologies. CPP has a debilitating effect on quality
of life, equivalent to those on dialysis, and is associated with psychological comorbidity including depression,
anxiety, and sleep disorders. Identifying the origin of the pelvic pain is typically the first step when choosing a
treatment strategy. However, identifying the etiology can be challenging in part because pain associated with
CPP is thought to become centralized over time and the dysfunction of one organ system often resulting in
pathologies in other organs.
Given the complex co-morbid conditions that define the phenotype of most patients with CPP, any treatment
that may potentially improve several downstream pelvic organs and/or symptoms is desirable. As such, we
propose to use sacral neuromodulation (SNM) as a treatment for CPP. SNM is a safe, effective, and minimally
invasive procedure used to treat urinary and fecal incontinence, frequency, urgency, and urinary retention.
Numerous retrospective studies have demonstrated a reduction in pelvic pain as a secondary outcome
measure with SNM. However, to date, no prospective placebo-controlled trial has been performed to assess
the effectiveness of SNM for pelvic pain specifically, in part because SNM is currently not an FDA approved
treatment for CPP. Thus, we hypothesize that sacral neuromodulation is effective at reducing pain in
patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We further hypothesize that single stage SNM
implantation is more cost-effective and provides higher benefit to pelvic pain patients than the
standard-of-care 2-stage approach.
Our hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1. Assess effectiveness of SNM in treating chronic
pelvic pain syndrome in women; 2. Evaluate cost-effectiveness of single stage versus standard-of-care
2-stage SNM. Beaumont Urology is internationally recognized for its expertise in neuromodulation and a large
number of women with CPP seek care at our Womenâ€™s Urology Center annually. Thus, our team is well-suited
to successfully complete these aims.
The outcomes of this study will have a far-reaching impact as it has the potential to significantly improve care
for CPP and simultaneously address many unknowns in the field of neuromodulation, such as determine the
placebo and carry-over effects. As such, study falls within the mission of this RFA to foster new and improved
treatment and pain management strategies for patients and to address specific NIDDK disorders of key
importance, namely Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome."

Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States, though many of them pay a heavy price for
their survivorship status due to long-term side effects from cancer therapies. Radiation cystitis (RC) results
from radiation therapy for pelvic cancers. RC is a debilitating and progressive bladder condition with no
effective therapy that may be life-threatening. Thus, the treatment that killed the cancer, may ultimately kill
the cancer survivor as well. Research in cancer survivorship is highly significant and represent a great
unmet need. This grant proposal is greatly innovative and results from our studies may lead to new
diagnosis and treatment for radiation cystitis.
The PI, Bernadette Zwaans, PhD, completed a successful and productive NIDDK K01 training award. The
KO1 was focused on a systematic research on better understanding of radiation cystitis using SARRP at
the capable and resourceful environment at Beaumont Research Institute. We developed an RC
preclinical model that closely mimics the human condition. In this model, we identified that RC is a biphasic
condition, characterized by urothelial damage in the weeks after radiation therapy (=acute RC), and by
chronic fibrosis, vascular damage, and loss of detrusor muscle in months to years after radiation therapy (=
chronic RC). We have identified Amphiregulin (AREG) to be significantly elevated after radiation therapy,
and to continue to grow in abundance over time. AREG is a member of the epidermal growth factor family
that binds the EGF receptor. It has been implicated in many processes including tissue regeneration,
cancer, tissue fibrosis, and cellular senescence. AREG is present throughout the body but is most
prominently expressed in the bladder urothelium. We hypothesize that AREG mediates radiation-induced
bladder fibrosis and can serve as a potential therapeutic target. We further hypothesize that AREG
can serve as a predictive urine biomarker to identify patients that are at risk for developing chronic
RC.
Our hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1. Determine the expression pattern of AREG
and its importance in maintaining urothelial integrity in normal and irradiated bladder; 2. Determine the role
of AREG in mediating radiation-induced fibrosis; 3. Assess AREG as a predictive biomarker for RC. Given
our experience with RC preclinical models our team is well-suited to successfully complete these aims.
This study is investigating the first potential therapeutic target for RC and its use as a predictive urine
biomarker. The outcomes of our studies can significantly improve the quality of life of many cancer
survivors suffering from severe bladder complications due to radiation therapy. Thus, this study falls within
the mission statement of the NIDDK to improve health and quality of life of cancer survivors."

Recent advancements using immune checkpoint inhibitors designed to target tumor-mediated
immune tolerance have revolutionized cancer therapy. Unfortunately, these clinical successes
have not translated to glioblastoma (GBM), which continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy
with limited treatment options. One of the leading thoughts in the field explaining this lack of
clinical benefit in GBM is that these agents are acting upon the wrong target. Tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) appear to represent the primary immune cells contributing towards the
immune suppressive microenvironment in GBM, vastly outnumbering T cell infiltration. Hence,
there is considerable interest in developing therapeutic strategies designed to target M2 TAMs or
revert their polarization to enhance antitumor immunity. We discovered the accumulation of
quinolinate (QA), a downstream intermediate of tryptophan metabolism, as a previously
undescribed metabolic node in GBM. Through a series of investigations, we went on to
demonstrate the potent ability of QA to sculpt the GBM immune landscape by polarizing
macrophages towards the immune suppressive M2 phenotype. Potent anti-tumor activity was
observed when tested in GBM lines grown intracranially, supporting the therapeutic potential of
targeting QA metabolism in GBM. In this proposal, we now seek to define mechanisms
contributing towards QA-mediated macrophage polarization (Aim 1), extend studies evaluating
the immunologic/metabolic consequence of targeting QA in GBM (Aim 2), and identify rational
combinatorial strategies designed to exploit inhibition of QA-induced immune suppression (Aim
3). If successful, these results would offer a previously unrecognized window into the complex
metabolic interplay between tumor and immune cells in the GBM microenvironment, its functional
consequence on immune suppression, and framework for the identification of novel therapeutic
strategies in this aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options."

The Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan (CRCWM) is an NCI Community Oncology Research
Program (NCORP) comprised of eleven hospitals and health systems and a medical school member. CRCWM
covers the west half of Michigan and cares for almost 16,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients and their families
per year. Formed from two experienced Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs) in 2014, CRCWM has
a 50-year history of bringing cancer clinical trials and education to the community, continues to be a major
accruer to National Cancer Institute (NCI) studies, and is acknowledged by the NCORP division as a high-
performance program.
With over 140 oncology physician investigators, 75 oncology nurse practitioners/ physician assistants, and a
well-established research operations team of 40 research nurses and coordinators, CRCWM has the ability to
enroll patients with cancer related diagnoses across the continuum and to address NCI goals of expanding
participation of underrepresented individuals in clinical trials. This application reiterates our commitment to high-
quality research and ongoing alignment with the NCI Cancer Plan and initiatives.
Strategic goals to meet this mission and vision include:
1. To maximize accrual of patients to cancer clinical trials sponsored by the NCI including priority studies for
treatment, cancer control/prevention/screening, molecular/precision medicine, and imaging.
2. To be strong contributors to Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR).
3. To maximize the sharing of NCI scientific findings into clinical care through education and engagement of
clinical partners and health systems.
4. To contribute to better understanding of health care gaps experienced by individuals who may be
underrepresented (e.g., rural, adolescent/young adult, and elderly) within our communities.
5. To optimize our contribution to the national scientific research agenda by expanding our leadership and
committee participation in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)/NCORP research bases and the
mentoring of young investigators.
CRCWM is well-positioned to continue forward this next year with the scope of work demonstrated consistently
throughout this grant cycle and by our long history of experience and success."
